&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/coronavirus_press_conferences_sample.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/coronavirus_press_conferences_sample_5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;from-the-books-afterword&quot;&gt;From the book’s afterword:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2020 the UK government began regular press briefings about the emerging coronavirus pandemic. These took place at a podium at Number 10 Downing Street where a minister, sometimes the Prime Minister, spoke directly to a static camera for five or so minutes before introducing advisors and taking questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These ministers had not expected to be dealing with this. They had been chosen for their belief in Brexit and their loyalty to Boris Johnson ahead of any experience or competence in running their departments. The ideological purge of politicians and civil servants by the Johnson regime in 2019 had left the UK government ill-equipped by any standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a year into the pandemic as I write this and over 100,000 people have died in the UK. Vaccines are being rolled out but the country feels dazed and confused, battered by mixed messages and contradictory instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/coronavirus_press_conferences_sample_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book covers the 89 press conferences uploaded to the Number 10 YouTube channel in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching them I was struck by how young they look. Dominic Raab, covering for Johnson when he was hospitalised with Covid, looks startled and terrified, while Matt Hancock has the air of an earnest son, very keen to get things right. Grant Shapps looks fresh from scraping a passing grade in his GCSEs, while Rishi Sunak reads his scripts in the manner of someone who definitely didn’t write them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there’s Johnson, the leader who hates to lead, hates to give bad news, hates to make hard decisions. His ruthless self-interest has always been masked by jocular bluster, but it is particularly ill-suited for this. We don’t need feel-good optimism. We need a framework to live and work in this new reality. We need honesty and clarity and compassion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/coronavirus_press_conferences_sample_3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speaking-to-a-fixed-camera trope, denoting seriousness and directness, lends itself well to the process I’ve employed in these artworks. The background is static while the speaker is animated. Extracting a shot every five seconds, I merge 100 or so frames using a focus-stacking algorithm, pulling out the sharpest points and smoothing the final result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The algorithm is not designed for this, so the results are always interesting. Teeth and eyes multiply, dark hair dominates, and white shirts bleach the image centre into a void. Later someone remembers their accessibility obligations and a signer is introduced, transformed into a manic pixie, all hands and grins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is a blur of chaotic emptiness. This is what it feels like to watch the Coronavirus Press Conferences&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/PM22Sep.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A response to watching Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s address to the nation on September 22nd, 2020. This was another turning point, as the virus started to surge into the autumn after a summer of lessened restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was struck by his hands had now stopped moving, compared to &lt;a href=&quot;/boris-hands/&quot;&gt;April&lt;/a&gt;. The gravity of the situation had finally hit home.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Boris_Hands_HD.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A response to watching Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s address to the nation on May 10th, 2020. This was a moment when the seriousness of the situation threatened to overtake optimistic bluster but didn’t quite succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was struck by his hands, how they never stopped moving, so I put frames from the speech through an image merging algorithm to draw them out. A ghostly Johnson face was added as a transparency to top it off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare to &lt;a href=&quot;/sept-22nd/&quot;&gt;September 22nd&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Waiting for Trump</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/WFT_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump was notorious for being late to his Coronavirus press briefings then suddenly arriving without warning. I discovered that the live streams began on time and consisted of a static shot of the reporters waiting patiently. In this particular video the reporters are waiting for 1 hour 13 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two versions. The first, above, is made with the focus-stacking algorithm. The second, below, is a standard averaging mimicking a long exposure photograph.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Manifestation of the Desire for Order in a Newly Chaotic World</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Manifestation_of_the_Desire_for_Order_in_a_Newly_Chaotic_World.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a hectic and traumatising March of full days and sleepless nights, I suddenly found myself furloughed in April and legally unable to work. This rapid stop was highly discombobulating and, while too exhausted to do anything substantial, I searched for something, anything, to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realising we were going to be spending a lot of time at home and in the garden, I set to work constructing a sunshade. I didn’t put much thought into the design and the emergent 2 metre square floating in the air quickly caught the attention of my neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appeared to be an expression of something deep in my soul, an articulation of loss, a desire for order. It conceptually moved from a practical piece of garden equipment to my first piece of lockdown art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was exhibited in the back garden until September 2020 when it was replaced with a geodesic dome. It has since been integrated into the shed awning extension by the rabbit run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During research for the 1972 project I came across a series of lithographs by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rauschenberg&quot;&gt;Robert Rauschenberg&lt;/a&gt; made in response to the Apollo 11 landing entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rauschenbergfoundation.org/art/series/stoned-moon-edition&quot;&gt;Stoned Moon&lt;/a&gt;. I found 16 of them online and crushed them together using a focus-stacking algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/49019838706/&quot;&gt;The work lives on Flickr&lt;/a&gt; where higher resolution versions of are available to download.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A print of this work was submitted to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artefactstirchley.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Artefact&lt;/a&gt; Winter Open, exhibited from Dec 5th 2019 to Jan 31st 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>1972 v0.1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The hardest part of &lt;a href=&quot;/1972/&quot;&gt;The 1972 Project&lt;/a&gt; was starting it, so I decided to make a film in a fortnight and present it show it to people regardless of its quality. No procrastination, no tweaking, just get it out there, and once it’s done, move on to the next thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was presented at The Magic Cinema at Artefact, Stirchley, on November 27th 2019, launching .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/374306726&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;transcript&quot;&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Punctuation was amended to coax the text-to-speech algorithm into phrasing more coherently and has been left intact because it amuses me to do so.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-1&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we reach the end of the second decade of the third millennium, two things are apparent. The world has, once again, gone bat fuck crazy, and the era of the internet, is at its zenith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some have speculated that these two things are related, and that in order to lance the boil something needs to happen. But beyond sticking plasters and hand-wringing, no-one seems to know what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the West, at least, our leaders hark back to past glories through populist blinkers. For better or worse, the left longs for new deals and welfare states while the right dreams of empire and divine right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the culture of the 21st century is stuck in the 20th, nostalgically regurgitating futures from a bygone age. Everything new is old again. The future is the past with a knowing wink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this matter? Well, the 20th Century did have some unfortunate side effects. The climate is fucked for a start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the last few decades of neoliberal economics do seem to have made a handful of people absurdly wealthy, to the detriment of everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can’t keep doing the same old thing and hoping it all works out. But imagining a different future, one that is truly of the future, seems to be getting harder and harder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Futurists used to be visionaries, dismantling the common-sense of the present, to figure out what might happen next. What are the futurists of today thinking?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2019, Jeff Bezos, boss of Amazon and world’s richest man, presented his dream, his endgame. All that he has done turned out to be in the service of giant space stations, orbiting the Earth and housing 10s of thousands of people. His space rocket company, Blue Origin, would lay the foundations for this epic technological feat, saving humanity and the Earth, whilst ensuring progress continued unimpeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems radically futuristic, but the idea is actually fifty years old. In 1969, Gerry O’Neill, a professor at Princeton University, asked his students, faced with the optimism of the Apollo programme and the dire state of the Vietnam War, to consider whether the surface of a planet is really the right place for an expanding technological civilization. They convinced him it wasn’t, and he spent the 1970s thinking about space colonies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1972 the final Apollo mission, number 17, went to the moon and the programme was cancelled. While the just-announced Space Shuttle was in development NASA searched furtively for a new mission to fill the yawning gap left by Apollo. What could come next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was Gerry O’Neill’s chance, and in 1975 he convened the first of three Conferences on Space Colonization, resulting in the now famous paintings of gigantic space stations populated by ordinary looking humans. This was to be America’s new frontier. Not shiny and militaristic, but green and Earth like. A new world for the next generation of pioneers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course these never came to pass. The political and economic will was not there, and Gerry O’Neill went back to teaching at Princeton, where, circa 1985, a young Star Trek fan called Jeff Bezos, whose high-school valedictorian speech was an earnest call for space colonisation, becomes his student. The rest of Bezos’s life, it seems, will be dedicated to fulfilling O’Neill’s dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Bezos hasn’t tried to update these designs. He hasn’t merged them with the last fifty years of technological and social change. He sees them as the solution to our problems but either our problems haven’t changed, or O’Neill’s solutions are eternal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe O’Neill was fifty years ahead of his time and it’s only now the world has caught up that Bezos can make it happen. Maybe O’Neill was a true futurist, and Bezos, king of the supply chain, is the pragmatist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a nice idea, but I think something was happening in the early 70s, specifically around 1972, that put us on a path that we seem incapable of changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-2&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;part-3&quot;&gt;Part 3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Pete Ashton and I am an artist based in Birmingham, a city in the north west of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1972 is the overarching title and theme of my work for the next three years, culminating on my fiftieth birthday in September 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next three years I will be making work about this half-century, exploring how it came to be, why we can’t seem to see a future whilst within it, and what that future might look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the work will be serious and didactic as fuck. Some will be daft and seemingly irrelevant. Some will be collaborative, while other work will be more personal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scope of this project is absurdly large, so I plan to use my life and my obsessions as a framework. As a child I was obsessed with NASA’s space programme. As a teen and into my 20s comic books led me deep into the counterculture and underground publishing. And in my 30s I made my home on the Internet with blogging and the early social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe these three things are deeply inter twing guld and I think may provide some useful answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please join me on this journey of exploration and illumination which I promise is not a mid-life crisis. Honest.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The 1972 Project</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The coronavirus pandemic has, of course, thrown numerous spanners in the works, not least rendering my brain incompetent during most of 2020. I do plan to revive this project though.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 1972 Project&lt;/strong&gt; is the overarching title of work I will be making between November 2019 and September 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was born in 1972 and the date has haunted me throughout my life, appearing on IDs, forms and drop-down menus. Yet I have no memory of that year and no real sense of what happened in that era because I was a baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking this a curious thing I decided to explore 1972 both as the seed of myself but also as the seed of my world. It turns out that it’s quite plausible to see the early 70s as a turning point in western society and it tracks nicely with my growing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My 1972 artworks will evolve and iterate over the next three years resulting in something around the date of my 50th birthday. This feels like a more interesting thing to do that a mid-life crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The works will be documented here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1972-version-01&quot;&gt;1972 version 0.1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;November 2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short film made to start the project, ensuring that it begins. Screened at The Magic Cinema, Artefact, November 27th 2019&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;September 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what form this will take. If you are an arts organisation (or similar) and are interested in hosting / exhibiting / supporting the final work in this project, please get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rivers of the World 2019</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/rotw2019-cameras.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://riversoftheworld.org&quot;&gt;Rivers of the World&lt;/a&gt; has been run by the Thames Festival since 2006, teaming up London schools with schools in cities around the world to learn about each other by exploring their local rivers. I worked for the project in 2018 when it expanded out of London for the first time and in 2019 returned to Worcester to run workshops at schools that were twinned with schools in Nairobi, Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I proposed using a camera obscura building workshop and for the pupils to use their hand-held cameras as viewing devices to find interesting and overlooked views in their school. The cameras were built from &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/docs/camera_obscura_template.pdf&quot;&gt;a simple template&lt;/a&gt; I designed using cardboard boxes, tracing paper and cheap plastic magnifying glasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To tie the workshop to their twin school in Kenya I asked the teachers to take lots of photos while on an exchange visit earlier in the year which I gave to the students as inspiration. I asked them to look for shapes patterns - triangles, circles, etc - rather than objects, and then photograph them with digital cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then documented the cameras they’d built and used all the matrials to produce a banner artwork which, at time of writing, will be exhibited on the bank of the Thames in London later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/rotw2019-montage.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Left to right: Nunnery Wood, Tudor Grange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nunnery-wood&quot;&gt;Nunnery Wood&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Nunnery Wood High School I worked with students who were either doing photography as part of their Art programme or were in the photography club. I asked them to find shapes in their teacher’s photos and trace them onto the screens in their cameras, using them as guides to line-up their views of the school, before photographing them. I also worked with a smaller group who were interested in the digital processes (focus stacking) I was abusing for the final work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The artwork was created by merging each student’s (or pair of students’) photos on top of a single photograph from Kenya and then montaging them into an abstract stained-glass window effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/rotw2019-nunnery.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tudor-grange&quot;&gt;Tudor Grange&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Tudor Grange School I was working with students without an art or photography background which gave a very different dynamic to Nunnery Wood. I lowered the expectations a bit and concentrated mostly on making and decorating the cameras and looking for patterns that they’d found in the teacher’s photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the camera obscuras had been central to the workshop I build the final artwork around them, as a frame for merges of their images as integrating photos of their decorated cameras. I also included some photos of the kids looking through them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Jo Gane's obscura research</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jogane.co.uk&quot;&gt;Jo Gane&lt;/a&gt;’s practice has been centred on early photographic techniques, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daguerreotype&quot;&gt;Daguerreotypes&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2019 she was “exploring links between early Photography and Drawing inspired by the work of Victorian painter Frederick Henry Henshaw and early photographer George Shaw.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She asked to borrow the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bhamobscura.com&quot;&gt;Birmingham Camera Obscura&lt;/a&gt;, which lives flatpacked in my shed, so we set it up along the River Cole where Henshaw and Shaw made work and she made some sketches of a bridge while I answered questions from confused dog walkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re an artist who’s interested in using the camera obscura as a tool in your practice, get in touch and we’ll see if we can work something out.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Crit Club for Black Hole Club</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blackholeclub.com&quot;&gt;Black Hole Club&lt;/a&gt; is an artist development programme run by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vividprojects.org.uk&quot;&gt;Vivid Projects&lt;/a&gt; in Birmingham. As part of the programme members are invited to present their work, or an aspect of their work, to their peers for discussion, similar to an art school crit, though more presentation-based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mine was on 9 October 2018 when I found myself in something of a quagmire artistically, having used the programme to experiment and see where I might go next but not coming up with any useful answers. (I subsequently took some time off from making art, returning to my practice in late 2019.) I decided to go right back to my childhood in the 80s and run through everything that seemed to inform my work so see if any patterns might emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/294255465&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Audio was recorded on my phone resting on the table, so volume varies as I move around. Introduced by Antonio Roberts, leader of the BHC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fellow BHC member &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emilyhroderick&quot;&gt;Emily Roderick&lt;/a&gt; kindly sent me her notes from my talk which I found fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Stirchley Salon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/salonlogo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artefactstirchley.co.uk&quot;&gt;Artefact&lt;/a&gt; is a cafe and art-space in Stirchley which attracts a lot of artists and curious people. As a regular there I felt there was a need for an event where those people could share what they’re up to with each other. Something formal, but not too formal. Something peer-based rather than promotional. Something that might seed ideas and future collaborations, or just friendships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That something was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artefactstirchley.co.uk/stirchley-salon&quot;&gt;Stirchley Salon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to start fairly formally with a solid structure. Two artists or makers would talk about an aspect of their practice for 20 minutes. It could be a method they use or a work completed. After this the group would discuss for 20 minutes what they’ve seen and how it might relate to their practice. With a break between artists the whole thing would be over in an hour and a half leaving plenty of time for informal chats afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was inspired by a few thing. The salon idea came from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_(gathering)&quot;&gt;artistic salons&lt;/a&gt; of the past, where poets and intellectuals would present new ideas and works to their peers. I was keen to keep it cross-media, not limiting to one form of art or another, from my experience at &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/live-sonification-photography/&quot;&gt;If Wet&lt;/a&gt; where my thoughts about photography were greatly expanded by listening to sound artists. Finaly, my experience speaking a and running &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pechakucha.com/cities/birmingham&quot;&gt;Pecha Kucha&lt;/a&gt; and similar short-talk events had shown me the benefit of helping people present their work in concise ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stirchley Salon ran monthly for the first half year and is now occasional, run by myself and Jonny Graney at Artefact. Anyone is welcome to speak or even run their own with our help and it has become an important part of their programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logo for the salon comes from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Salon_de_Madame_Geoffrin.jpg&quot;&gt;painting&lt;/a&gt; of a reading of Voltaire’s L’Orphelin de la Chine in the salon of Madame Geoffrin, in front of a piece of graffiti that was very prevalent in Stirchley a couple of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some photos from salons past.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dead Shrines</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/deadshines00004.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hipkissandgraney.com/the-dead-shrines-project&quot;&gt;Dead Shrines&lt;/a&gt; is an ongoing project by artist duo &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hipkissandgraney.com/&quot;&gt;Hipkiss and Graney&lt;/a&gt;, constructing large wooden sculptures in public spaces as a focus for community-focussed events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was heavily involved in designing the Dead Shrine for Stirchley Park and ran two events in the subsequent programme, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/Byfe0_sl0-y/&quot;&gt;camera obscura making workshop&lt;/a&gt; and a talk on the history of the camera obscura and why it might be relevant today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following images document the design, build and events I took part in. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/stirchleyshrine/the-dead-shrines-project-stirchley-park?ref=user_menu&quot;&gt;The Kickstarter video&lt;/a&gt; shows my working with Jonny and Dale before the build began. A documentary film by Hipkiss and Graney will be released soon, at which point I’ll try to write in more detail about what we did and how. And maybe why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scab is a 3D model build using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry&quot;&gt;photogrammetry&lt;/a&gt; from frames taken from a video of a repeatedly scratched mosquito bite on my leg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was produced for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blackholeclub.hotglue.me&quot;&gt;Black Hole Club’s online exhibition&lt;/a&gt; where members were invited to explore how their practices exists in an online space.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Are You Satisfied?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/maclean-bullring.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2017, I, along with Fiona and a few BOM friends, were extras in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rachelmaclean.com&quot;&gt;Rachel Maclean&lt;/a&gt;’s new film Are You Satisfied, made as part of her Channel 4 sponsored residency at Birmingham’s Bullring shopping centre which was broadcast a year later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.peteashton.com/1533688860&quot;&gt;I wrote about the experience here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At time of writing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-shopping-centre-artist-in-residence&quot;&gt;the C4 programme&lt;/a&gt; is still on their iPlayer-clone.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Flash</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/flash_before_after.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flash was an installation for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blackholeclub.com&quot;&gt;Black Hole Club&lt;/a&gt; group show &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vividprojects.org.uk/programme/another-dimension/&quot;&gt;Another Dimension&lt;/a&gt; at Vivid Projects in June/July 2018. It was an attempt to tie together a few big ideas with an indoor camera obscura device. It didn’t really work as I intended and was a bit of a disappointment, but that’s fine. It was still a useful exercise in… something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept I was working with was that images exist in memory and that this is interesting. The eye can register something for a split second, say under a lightning flash, but the consideration of that thing will take place using the image stored in the brain. In that sense, the brain is the memory card recording images captured by the sensor at the back of our camera-like eyes. Except brain-memory doesn’t just store images - it adds to and multiplies their meaning, merging them with other memories and ideas to make better sense of them. Seeing is just the first part of how we experience the world visually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I wanted a device that would flash an image at the viewer which they would then hold in their memories. I didn’t want to use a video screen, as video screens are boring and I was feeling the urge to &lt;em&gt;make stuff&lt;/em&gt; using wood. I used a multi-lens camera obscura idea I’d played with at a workshop to create a composite-eye effect of overlapping images of nearly the same view. This would project at 20cm onto a sheet of translucent paper. The projection would be lit by a strobe light, set to randomly fire by an Arduino controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole thing was housed in a wooden frame covered in black plastic to keep the gallery lights out. Inside was a white sheet painted with a Dazzle Ship pattern, referencing the ideas of perception I was thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end result was a black box with a screen onto which an abstract shape appeared every few seconds. Technically it was a success. Artistically, I’m totally not sure. But that’s what Black Hole Club is partly for - experimenting with your practice and failing in a safe space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I described it in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/2ur8y41gu6m454n/BHC_Another_Dimension_programme.pdf?dl=0&quot;&gt;programme&lt;/a&gt; as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Part of a series of lens-based works exploring the mediation of reality by creative tools, Flash is a multiple-lens camera obscura that mimics a lighting flash viewed by an insect.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>City Arcadia mini-residency</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://coventry-artspace.co.uk&quot;&gt;Coventry Artspace&lt;/a&gt; has a unit in the soon-to-be-demolished City Arcadia shopping centre which members of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blackholeclub.com&quot;&gt;Black Hole Club&lt;/a&gt; were invited to use for three days to mess around with audio/visual technology and see where it took them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to use this opportunity to do an audit of all the random cameras, sensors and computers I’d gathered over my &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/bom-fellowship/&quot;&gt;BOM Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; and related projects like Speculative Cameras, to see if I was still interested in any of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather embarrasingly at the time it turned out I wasn’t. Whatever it was I wanted to do with my art, it probably wasn’t going to involve these boxes of tech. Which, on reflection, meant I had a clean slate to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did produce one piece of work, an homage to Adam Magyar’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/83663312&quot;&gt;Stainless&lt;/a&gt; which I shot with my phone on the train in to Coventry and back to Birmingham. I put this in the window of the unit for the duration of the residency.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Open Zine Archive</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/OAZ03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the 1990s I was involved in the self-published comics and zines community in the UK. Initially as a reviewer, and then a distributor, I would receive countless photocopies and short-run publications, predominantly comics or about comics but also a wide range of topics, some obscure, some underground, some just weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ceased being involved in this scene around 2000, drawing a line so I could concentrate on new things, initially blogging and then photography. But I never got rid of the zines because I knew they had the potential to be unique. I became their custodian, keeping them safe in case one day they became important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the internet exploded and the need for alternative and underground communities to use print and postal services diminished, the zine scenes of my day evaporated. But an interest in this physical medium rumbled along amongst the next generation of freaks and weirdos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of these weirdonauts, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/katie_stafford&quot;&gt;Katie Stafford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Kaaaaaaaaaaath&quot;&gt;Katharine Wade&lt;/a&gt;, heard of my boxes of zines and, having dabbled in zine production themselves, were intrigued. They spent an afternoon digging through the stacks and proposed a simple exhibition at Artefact, the local arts cafe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loaded everything in to my car and Kath, at a loss as to how to curate it, emptied absolutely everything out. The end result was quite something and cause all manner of long-forgotten feelings and memories to rush back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fellow zine-reviewer from those days &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jezuk.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Jez Higgins&lt;/a&gt; joined me for an evening of talking about this stuff to people half our age which was entertaining if a little haphazard, and the exhibition ran for a week generating a fair amount of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, this is a period that I have left behind. I have no interest in working with this collection, but I am open to others exploring it with my supervision. If this is something that you think you might like to do, please get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installation piece for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vividprojects.org.uk/programme/stellar/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stellar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a group show commissioned by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lumenstudios.co.uk/about/&quot;&gt;Lumen&lt;/a&gt; for members of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blackholeclub.com&quot;&gt;Black Hole Club&lt;/a&gt;. Exhibited at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vividprojects.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Vivid Projects&lt;/a&gt;, Birmingham, 27/4 to 4/5 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optical lenses enable us to see the otherwise invisible, from the microscopic to deep space, and to assist the otherwise sightless. This work hangs an array of 144 lenses, taken from a vintage opticians diagnosis set, across a projection of deep space imagery. A small fan on the floor gently animates them as they distort and refocus the light that falls through them. Visitors are invited to experience the light captured and manipulated by these human-crafted objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before de-installing the piece I wanted to see how other styles of video would work with the lenses.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blow-Up 2018</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/blowup2018poster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A poster imagining a reboot of Michelangelo Antonioni’s classic 1966 thriller &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowup&quot;&gt;Blow-up&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;strong&gt;Blow-up 2018&lt;/strong&gt;, drawing paralells between the fashion photographer’s indiference to his model and the corporate indifference of Google and Facebook to the personal data we present to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the remake, David Hemmings no longer plays a fictionalised David Bailey, dripping with toxic masculinity masquerading as “cool”, but is cast as a data centre, seen by many as the purest manifestation of data-churning internet giants. Fashion model Veruschka retains her orignal role as raw material, to be groomed, teased, manipulated, her image productised for the benefit of others and her body ultimately discarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more things change, the more they stay the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene in question has been crudely manipulated by myself to accompany the poster mimicking cliches of “computer vision” in the following video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;vid&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/262418293&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poster was part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vividprojects.org.uk/programme/blackholeclub2018/&quot;&gt;Black Hole Club 2018 group show&lt;/a&gt; at Vivid Projects, 30th March 2018. Here’s a picture of me standing next to it, looking disconcertingly smug.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rivers of the World 2018</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ByhRmHz8XiE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://riversoftheworld.org&quot;&gt;Rivers of the World&lt;/a&gt; has been run by the Thames Festival since 2006, teaming up London schools with schools in cities around the world to learn about each other by exploring their local rivers. In 2018 the project expanded out of London for the first time and I was employed to run workshops at schools in Worcestershire that were twinned with schools in Nairobi, Kenya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked in three schools over two days per school. We explored the river, recording it using predominantly cameras, and then produced artworks in the classroom which I finished off at home. Because I was working in a digital medium a lot of my work was done after the sessions (otherwise the pupils would be watching progress bars all afternoon) so we filled the days with producing materials for me to process later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was hired in part for the work I’d done using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_stacking&quot;&gt;Focus Stacking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry&quot;&gt;Photogrammetry&lt;/a&gt;, digital processes where I use algorithmic systems incorrectly to produce strange perspectives, so I used them in the works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final pieces were exhibited as tall banners at London’s OXO Tower in September 2018 and then toured the UK through the Autumn and Winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/rotw2018-montage.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Left to right: Tenbury, Evesham (St Egwin’s), Pershore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tenbury-high&quot;&gt;Tenbury High&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shops in Tenbury define it as the historic market town for the area. While by the river the students photographed shop fronts and collected objects that would normally be ignored. They printed out the shop pictures and used the images as the basis for collages, building a fantasy Tenbury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Techniques: photography, mixed-media collage, focus-stacking, auto-fill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/rotw2018_tenbury.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;st-egwins-evesham&quot;&gt;St Egwin’s, Evesham&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually a river flows through a town, but Evesham is defined by the physical shape of the river, so the artwork was built around that, creating five collages of the town from above. Each student took as many photos as they could which were randomly collected and digitally combined to produce collage materials. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/albums/72157694373999381&quot;&gt;The collage materials are archived here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Techniques: photography, mixed-media collage, focus-stacking,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/rotw2018_evesham.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pershore-high&quot;&gt;Pershore High&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see the Working River from the past to the present the students visited a stretch of the Avon near Eckington. Students shot short videos of interesting objects which were then converted to 3D models. The piece uses texture maps generated for the models mixed with paintings inspired by them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Techniques: video, photogrammetry, woodcut, painting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/rotw2018_pershore.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was hired again for &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/rotw-2019/&quot;&gt;Rivers of the World 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Instructions for Humans</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/ifh/puerto-rico-celltower.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-cargo-cult-for-artificial-intelligence&quot;&gt;A Cargo Cult for Artificial Intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three months of new work production exploring human interactions with complex systems, centred around and lending its name to a wider Instructions for Humans exhibition exploring Internet art in an age of mass surveillance at &lt;a href=&quot;http://bom.org.uk&quot;&gt;BOM (Birmingham Open Media)&lt;/a&gt; from 13 September to 16 December 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phenomena of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult&quot;&gt;cargo cults&lt;/a&gt; was observed on South Pacific islands after WWII as islanders used ritual to try and make sense of the advanced military technology that had suddenly entered their lives. Instructions for Humans asks: what might a cargo cult for artificial intelligence look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work uses recent developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to explore the systems that guide society and our relationship to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work produced in the gallery was documented on the website &lt;a href=&quot;http://instructionsforhumans.com&quot;&gt;instructionsforhumans.com&lt;/a&gt;. Key works generated during the project are archived here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://art.peteashton.com/instructions-for-humans/&quot;&gt;Instructions for Humans&lt;/a&gt; exhibition, where I was resident in the gallery each day, &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/user24551395&quot;&gt;Mark Hancock&lt;/a&gt; came by to interview me for his occasional series of artist profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Transcripts of Humans</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The artist is based in the gallery from September to December 2017 for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://instructionsforhumans.com/&quot;&gt;Instructions for Humans&lt;/a&gt; exhibition. Visitors are invited to talk to the artist about the exhibition. These conversations with the artist are recorded because the artist has a terrible memory and would like to know what was talked about. The recordings are summarised by the transcriber, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KCanard&quot;&gt;Karen Cameron&lt;/a&gt;. The transcriber was not in the gallery and only has the audio from one microphone to go on. Errors and assumptions are made. These are not corrected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The artist presents the trascripts on the walls of the gallery and has conversations with visitors about them. The transcriber continues to summarise conversations, some of which are now about her transcripts. This produces &lt;a href=&quot;https://amwritingthings.tumblr.com/post/166671665230/systems-in-the-text&quot;&gt;interesting feedback loops&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://instructionsforhumans.com/transcripts/&quot;&gt;The transcripts are archived online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Data Cult</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/ifh/datacult-em.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Cult&lt;/strong&gt; was a series of performances attempting to make sense of data-driven surveillance technologies and our relationship with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to understand the intangible networks that surround us, it is sometimes useful to imagine their absence and to explore the space left behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Cult exists in a world where the network, its sensors and processors, have suddenly vanished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://a-w-a.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Aleks Wojtulewicz&lt;/a&gt; spent the week leading up to the event attempting to process surveillance footage and communicate its content to a camera. He does this through a code built of exercise routines until his body is exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://emily-warner.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Warner&lt;/a&gt; used algorithmically generated icons from the pre-absence era to guide her movements, which she attempted to record using ropes and weights. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KCanard&quot;&gt;Karen Cameron&lt;/a&gt; annotates the piece in real time creating a feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The works were devised with Pete Ashton who continued to process data collected from them over the duration of the exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The framework chosen for this is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult&quot;&gt;Cargo Cult&lt;/a&gt; phenomena from South Pacific islands, specifically how they emerged in the late 1940s as a response to the sudden disappearance of military supply chains between the US and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s my contention that these cults, being driven by the absence of a technology that had dominated and changed their society, give us a valuable tool for understanding the shape and quality of systems that are otherwise intangible and opaque. Just as the sudden absence of an air conditioner hum has a tangible nature, the absence of The Network reveals to us its salient features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Cult was part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://instructionsforhumans.com&quot;&gt;Instructions for Humans&lt;/a&gt; exhibition and premiered at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bom.org.uk&quot;&gt;BOM&lt;/a&gt; (Birmingham Open Media) on November 6th 2017. Documentation and derived artworks are archived on this page.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cell Tower Mast For Sympathetic Magic</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A wooden triangle structure with three H shapes on each corner mimicking the antenna of a cell tower mast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2017/09/disconnected-by-disasterphotos-from-a-battered-puerto-rico/540975/#img08&quot;&gt;a photo from Puerto Rico post-hurricane&lt;/a&gt; where people are gathered around a cell tower waiting for the signal to come back on. Traditionally folk would gather at the church or town hall for information or solace, but this is now provided by the digital network which is physically manifested by the tower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This connected with my interest in the post-WWII &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult&quot;&gt;cargo cults&lt;/a&gt; of the South Pacific and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://curiousrituals.nearfuturelaboratory.com&quot;&gt;gestures and rituals&lt;/a&gt; that have emerged during the Internet age.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Black Box</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Black Box is a 3 metre tall monoliths that spits out a piece of paper on average once a minute. On this paper are “instructions” in text and visual form, generated by a machine learning algorithm. The visitor is invited to take a piece of paper that resonates with them and use it in whatever way they see fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Black Box references &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box&quot;&gt;black box systems&lt;/a&gt; “which can be viewed in terms of their inputs and outputs without any knowledge of its internal workings.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ars Electronic 2017</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/ars2017.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017 I applied for and received an Engine micro-bursary from &lt;a href=&quot;http://newartwestmidlands.co.uk&quot;&gt;New Art West Midlands&lt;/a&gt; to visit the Ars Electronica Festival in Linz, Austria, in return for writing a report about it for those back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://newartwestmidlands.co.uk/editorial/pete-ashton-on-ars-electronica-linz/&quot;&gt;The report is here&lt;/a&gt; and archived below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/goodbye-wittgenstein/&quot;&gt;Linz residency in 2016&lt;/a&gt; I was able to stay with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://qujochoe.org/&quot;&gt;qujOchÖ&lt;/a&gt; artist collective who invited me to be part of the performance of their game &lt;a href=&quot;https://qujochoe.org/myth-of-theuth-ars-electronica-festival-2017/&quot;&gt;Myth of Theuth&lt;/a&gt;, which got me accreditation as an Artist, which was nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/MYTHOS_VON_THEUTH_ARS_ELECTRONICA_2017_170910_26.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;pete-ashton-on-ars-electronica-linz&quot;&gt;Pete Ashton on Ars Electronica, Linz&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aec.at/festival/&quot;&gt;Ars Electronica&lt;/a&gt; is a large media arts festival and as such it functions like most large industry gatherings, albeit with a less rapaciously commercial imperative. It takes place in the city of Linz, the third largest in Austria, roughly 2/3rds the size of Wolverhampton, give or take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ars Electronica (commonly shortened to Ars, which makes smutty British people snigger at your visiting Arse) was founded in 1979 and is based around the Ars Electronica Centre, a science museum for future technology manifesting as a glowing cube of flashing lights on the banks of the Danube. It appears to house very little art, which is a bit confusing when visiting during the festival, but uses what you might call a cultural mindset to frame the exhibits on show. There’s also a strong emphasis on pixels and screens. Lots of VR goggles at the moment alongside their much vaunted “8K Deep Space” room where multiple high definition projectors fill the wall and floor like a slightly more immersive IMAX. Like most “big telly” spaces in cultural institutions, the challenge seems to be figuring out what it’s for. Maybe it’s just a big telly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This “future technology” thing sometimes makes the place feel old fashioned, a problem futurism has bumped into in recent years. As we fumble our way through the end days of neoliberalism it’s harder and harder to imagine a future that isn’t part of our tattered reality tunnel, so futures that wish to avoid &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebaffler.com/outbursts/future-fail-silverman&quot;&gt;doomed dystopic nihilism&lt;/a&gt; have to remix the past, only smaller and faster and with more pixels. Ars gamely tries to bring earnest social concern to their tech evangelism but to these jaded eyes it feels a bit naive. Still, it’s refreshing to see a European take on what has become dominated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Californian_Ideology&quot;&gt;The Californian Ideology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the centre runs all year, the festival takes place for a week in September, and in recent years has completely separated from the mothership, occupying Postcity which is not a new space for exploring post-city ideologies and is actually an empty disused post office sorting depot. This is oddly refreshing, like discovered something called an Innovation Centre was actually used for innovation, which never happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The space is vast, covering three massive floors, some still kitted out with conveyor belts and mail sorting chutes, down to the ominously named Bunker complex which feels like a cold-war installation. It’s on a scale with a convention centre, but without any of the facilities. Ars brings it to life once a year, filling it with industrial fittings to create stalls, booths and workshops while decorating the concrete with potted long grasses. The end result evokes a post-industrial takeover by a tribe of techno-futurists, especially when all the Media Artists arrive with their fashion cliches and quirks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You enter at the top floor via a sweeping service road built for lorries and collect your badge, although this is not technically needed for the top floor which is open to all. This floor is roughly divided into two areas. First is what I call the Tech Demos, works by artists that show their workings more than their meanings and which might lead to greater things in time, and demonstrations of cool technologies with no pretensions of artistry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The former included most of the Artificial Intelligence which, to my mind, still hasn’t produced a great work yet. They’re using an artistic approach to poke at this relatively new technology and reveal some of its weirdness, and that’s great, but I doubt any of the artists involved are satisfied yet. There’s more work to be done. The later reflects the main Ars centre. Lots of mind-control headsets, lots of robot arms, all very wow but of very little substance. But that’s fine. We don’t always have much wow in our lives. Often wow is enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downstairs is what you might call the real art. Threaded through the maze of tunnels are installations and curated exhibitions, some commissioned by the festival along with a collections from commercial galleries across Europe. Developing the market for digital art, often by definition intangible, is one of the the strands at Ars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The art on show was on a very high standard. I was particularly impressed the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stefan Tiefengraber’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aec.at/ai/en/delivery-graphic/&quot;&gt;Delivery Graphic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gaybird’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aec.at/ai/en/fidgety/&quot;&gt;Fidgity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Akinori Goto’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aec.at/ai/en/sculpture-of-time/&quot;&gt;Sculpture of Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gil Delindro’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aec.at/ai/en/un-measurements/&quot;&gt;(Un) Measurements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Robert Andrew’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aec.at/ai/en/data-stratification/&quot;&gt;Data Stratification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the upstairs was a fun-house of excitement the downstairs more that made up for that with plenty of space for contemplation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, one man’s impression of a massive event like this is going to be subjective and informed by my state of mind. While I had the eye of a practitioner I also had the attitude of a tourist, so I was interested in how the locals felt about this whale of a festival landing on their town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I was in Linz for a residency run by &lt;a href=&quot;http://qujochoe.org&quot;&gt;qujOchÖ&lt;/a&gt;, a collective of local artists that’s been working in the city since 2001. When I said I would be returning for Ars, one of the founder members, Thomas Philipp aka Fipps graciously said I could stay with him. This, coupled with my introvert approach to mingling, meant I followed qujOchÖ members around like a lost puppy, giving me something of a grass roots view of the whole affair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Austrians, it turns out, are famously cynical and grumpy (their term “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/What-is-life-like-in-Vienna-Austria&quot;&gt;sudern&lt;/a&gt;” is hard to define but is rather like a Gaelic shrug soaked in nihilistic disappointment) so it wasn’t too much of a surprise to hear the local artists bitching in the bars late at night about programme changes and managerial incompetence. And I’m sure you’d hear that in any city - big events are hard and toes will be trodden on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I was surprised as the lack of impact on the local scene. I would have thought this would be their tentpole event, a chance to show off local work to a visiting global audience (and Ars is truly a global affair). But the impact was negligible. A lot of people got technical work, of course, and one of the shows at the main art museum was by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aec.at/ai/en/timesup/&quot;&gt;a dystopian docklands by local collective Time’s Up&lt;/a&gt; (which had an oddly English vibe I felt), but this was an anomaly and where the Linz scenes were represented it was on the unofficial fringe where business was as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the effect of Ars happened years ago and the city is now sustainable without it, allowing the festival to become a transnational entity, bringing inspiration in rather than exporting it. The local artists are complacent about it because it’s normal. Surely every city has a massive, international, popular, thoughtful and, most importantly, competently run arts festival? Sadly, they don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Birmingham had the equivalent of Ars Electronica (ignoring for the moment that this city is currently financially, ideologically and structurally incapable of such a feat) it would change everything for the artists working here. Not just from the sense of having an infrastructure or an income but from shifting our horizons and giving us a global perspective on our work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, a couple of months after Ars, &lt;a href=&quot;https://coventrybiennial.com&quot;&gt;Coventry had it’s first Biennial&lt;/a&gt; centred on an exhibition of contemporary art in an empty newspaper print-works. Despite the grand name (Biennials make one think of Venice) it was a totally grass-roots, shoestring budget affair, utterly hooked into the local art scenes. It was fired not by routine or remit but by a passion that, fuck it, this needs to happen and we can make it happen. The Coventry Biennial, should it continue and grow, will bring stability and continuity to a community of artists that will raise their game. And should it succeed beyond their wildest dreams, those same artists will kick against it, sneering at its conservatism and conformity, at its inability to react and embrace what’s happening in the city it helped to transform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s exactly the way it should be.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Developed in Birmingham</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jennyduffin.com/developed-in-birmingham&quot;&gt;Developed in Birmingham&lt;/a&gt; was a season of events over the summer 2017 centred on two major exhibitions of early photography in the city, Thresholds, a virtual reality exhibition by Matt Collishaw and A White House on Paradise Street by Jo Gane, curated by Pete James and produced by Jenny Duffin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did two projects, a &lt;strong&gt;Speculative Cameras&lt;/strong&gt; workshop on 19 August, using the history of the camera from obscuras to 3D modelling to explore artistic potentials, and a &lt;strong&gt;Camera Obscura Portrait Studio&lt;/strong&gt; installed from 7 - 12 August with a workshop on the 12th. I also brought the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bhamobscura.com&quot;&gt;Birmingham Camera Obscura&lt;/a&gt; out on 29 August to accompany a Cyanotypes workshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Speculative Cameras workshop&lt;/strong&gt; was indebted to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/levin-exp-cap/&quot;&gt;Golan Levin’s Experimental Capture workshop&lt;/a&gt; I attended in 2016 along with my own research as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/bom-fellowship/&quot;&gt;BOM Fellow&lt;/a&gt;. We looked at cameras that did not fit the accepted definition of cameras and processes that did not necessarily produce photographs, to get us thinking about these tools in new and creative ways. Starting with the camera obscura as a process that can be made from a house or a cardboard box we also looked at making junk lenses from random transparent material to bend and warp light, photogrammetery to build 3D models from videos of objects, the infrared photography of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.richardmosse.com/&quot;&gt;Richard Mosse&lt;/a&gt; as an introduction to capturing light invisible to the human eye, and finished with a discussion about machine vision and machine learning techniques that were being bundled with the emerging artificial intelligence hype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was sold out and we had really good feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://sketchfab.com/models/500e4061685e4ccaaa819765a3f2aff6/embed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen; vr&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3D scan of a participant, made by videoing them from all sides, extracting frames and processing them using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agisoft.com&quot;&gt;Photoscan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Camera Obscura Portrait Studio&lt;/strong&gt; was an attempt to recreate David Hockney’s experiment documented in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://thamesandhudson.com/secret-knowledge-rediscovering-the-lost-techniques-of-the-old-masters-9780500286388&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9lYROQRvjw&quot;&gt;TV show&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Secret Knowledge&lt;/em&gt; where he builds a camera obscura to prove his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockney–Falco_thesis&quot;&gt;thesis&lt;/a&gt; that the Great Masters used optics in their work. I designed and built a tent within Birmingham Museum &amp;amp; Art Gallery with a lens at one end and drawing paper at the other. It was set to focus on people sitting in a chair so they could be sketched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not perfect, due mainly to the lack of light that week, but it worked and got a lot of attention with a good few hundred people coming through. On reflection it probably should have been built outside, but we didn’t have the venue for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/devbham1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The studio blacked out and emblazoned with explanations of what this weird object is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jennyduffin.com/&quot;&gt;Jenny Duffin&lt;/a&gt;, my collaborator on the Bham Obscura project, for her invaluable assistance in both these pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>APHE Human Interfaces conference</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was one of the artists speaking at this conference in Norwich on 20th July 2017. Unfortunately there doesn’t seem to be a record of it on the web any more so you’ll have to take my word for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If some evidence does emerge again, I’ll post it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note to self - expect conference websites to last no longer than two years after which the domain and hosting will expire. Archive that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Echo Edit</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/echoedit-anchorman.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;echo-edit&quot;&gt;Echo Edit&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/instructions-for-humans/&quot;&gt;Instructions for Humans&lt;/a&gt; saw me collaborate with performance artists. In order to work with those artists I needed to put myself in their shoes to properly understand what I’m asking them to do. I need to become a performance artist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Echo Edit&lt;/strong&gt; was proposed as a durational performance piece in response to an &lt;a href=&quot;http://hfwas.co.uk/?p=3694&quot;&gt;open call&lt;/a&gt; for It’s Alive! put out by local performance art collective Home For Waifs And Strays and experimental film night &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/themagiccinema/&quot;&gt;Magic Cinema&lt;/a&gt; on the theme of Live Art + Cinema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Echo Edit was my first piece of public performance art. In recent years I’ve become interested in the medium, mostly because I don’t understand it and find some of it impenetrable and uncomfortable. I think embracing these feelings and integrating it into my own practice might be useful, possibly in the same way I found hanging around with sound artists made me think about photography (light art, if you like) in new and exciting ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merging performance and data art is not a new thing and there are a few artists and works I’ve seen over the years which have pushed me along this path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;inspiration&quot;&gt;Inspiration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.creativeapplications.net/can_labs/transcranial/&quot;&gt;Transcranial&lt;/a&gt;, a trio of pieces by Klaus Obermaier, Daito Manabe and Kyle McDonald, which I saw performed at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://resonate.io/2015/projects/transcranial/&quot;&gt;Resonate festival in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, was all about the live collaboration between dancer/performers on stage and programmers in the wings. For Klaus Obermaier’s section a video feed of the dancers is fed through algorithmic processes and projected onto the stage. The dancers can then “play” the algorithms by altering their movements, while Klaus tweaks or switches the algorithms to “play” the dancers. Equilibrium is found and lost as the performance plays out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://emily-warner.com&quot;&gt;Emily Warner&lt;/a&gt; was one of the other artists on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/goodbye-wittgenstein/&quot;&gt;Goodbye Wittgenstien&lt;/a&gt; residency in Austria last year and is exactly the sort of performance artist that confuses the hell out of me, though I do enjoy her work a lot. Working alongside her for that month was really illuminating and our conversations have led to her being one of the main collaborators for &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/instructions-for-humans/&quot;&gt;Instructions for Humans&lt;/a&gt;. Mostly it’s the procedural, ritualised nature of her work and how she responds to a space or object with movement. I see parallels to the act of photography, which is really interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/193879696&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, again at Resonate, I got onto the &lt;a href=&quot;http://resonate.io/2017/workshop/hacking-choreography/&quot;&gt;Hacking Choreography&lt;/a&gt; workshop with &lt;a href=&quot;http://sicchio.com&quot;&gt;Kate Sicchio&lt;/a&gt;, a dance choreographer and tech-artist who has connections to the live-coding &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorave&quot;&gt;Algorave&lt;/a&gt; scene. One of her pieces, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.sicchio.com/works/hacking-choreography/&quot;&gt;Hacking Choreography&lt;/a&gt;, sees her use a human-readable &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode&quot;&gt;pseudocode&lt;/a&gt; to give instructions to dancers, defining moves and setting “if-then” loops. Other than the insight into choreography and scoring movement, it was good to get a sense of how the human performer relates to the process and the freedom of interpretation they have. The work is not scored in the sense of an orchestral score where players (within reason) have to do as they’re told, but scored in a more suggestive way, creating a dialogue through the code and their response to it. In other words, the dancers can ignore their instructions, which is as valid a feedback signal as obeying them perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memo Akten’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@memoakten/shm12-science-technology-culture-tradition-6c45e2249afb&quot;&gt;Simple Harmonic Motion #12&lt;/a&gt; was a performance piece commissioned for the Future Everything festival in Manchester which I saw in 2015. A row of 16 percussionists played a simple rhythmic piece which fell in and out of phase (a la &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum_Music&quot;&gt;Steve Reich’s Pendulum Music&lt;/a&gt;). Each player was responding to a click-track playing in their ear which they had to replicate. Obviously some made errors, which gave what could have been a rigid, militaristic piece a sense of organic humanity. I really liked the use of humans as meat-circuits in a mechanical system and the requirement that they not be perfect. (Memo has recently been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.memo.tv/learning-to-see/&quot;&gt;developing work&lt;/a&gt; using machine learning and computer perception so the thread from the SHM series is nice to explore.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/121346716&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously there’s more to each of these than the sliver I’m highlighting here for my personal use and I’d recommend exploring them further. And there were other people and things along the way, which I’ll doubtless remember once this is posted, but you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;objectives&quot;&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of &lt;strong&gt;Echo Edit&lt;/strong&gt; was to force myself to be a performance artist so I could work with performance artists more collaboratively. If I am asking them to come into my world of data-art then I need to go into their world of physical movement. This is not something I find comfortable. While I do certainly use gesture and movement in my work (from gesticulating while teaching to the physical contortions needed to get that specific photograph) consciously making gestures without literal value feels very weird to me. When I dance it’s not deliberative or performative. It’s just dancing. This would be movement on purpose with no purpose. Weirdness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had put myself in a similar position on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/goodbye-wittgenstein/&quot;&gt;Goodbye Wittgenstien&lt;/a&gt; residency while experimenting with new ways to render photographic data. The previous occupant of my studio had left some soft charcoal pencils, a medium I’ve never dreamed of using. The reason I use cameras and keyboards is I cannot actualise what’s in my brain with a pencil. I just lack the motor skills, I guess. But I can trace, so I projected my composite image on the wall and traced every detail. The process was fascinating as I was acting in a completely mindless way, like a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotter&quot;&gt;plotter printer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; defer=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting work was framed next to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/30969130495/in/album-72157675032963546/&quot;&gt;the original digital image&lt;/a&gt; in my section of our group exhibition. A lot of my work was algorithmic, in the sense that I was pushing stuff through a computational process to see what it would keep and discard (the original in this case was created by using Photoshop to merge lots of very different photos with the focus-stacking Auto Blend algorithm (&lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/auto-blending-2016/&quot;&gt;see also&lt;/a&gt;)) and here I was using my self as a computation process. I see the shape, I move my hand to trace the shape. It becomes a very mechanical movement with little conscious thought, but the glitches and errors betray my character and humanity. Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peteash10/Goodbye-Wittgenstein/master/stuff/31180533001_b300347960_k.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peteash10/Goodbye-Wittgenstein/master/stuff/30487606753_b55a35b5c6_k.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reminded me of a writing class run by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Goldsmith&quot;&gt;Ken Goldsmith&lt;/a&gt; which he described in an interview I now can’t find, but the gist is he asked his students to copy a text word for word. In the process they made mistakes and errors. These errors were the interesting bit. He also talks &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theskinny.co.uk/things-to-do/heads-up/kenneth-goldsmith-on-uncreative-writing&quot;&gt;in this interview&lt;/a&gt; about how “if you and I were to transcribe an identical conversation we would transcribe it completely differently. And so this is a validation of this kind of writing: people say that this isn’t writing; it’s merely transcription; but in fact it is very unique and individual writing.” Goldsmith is a prankster, but he’s a very serious one and he’s on to something here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is this sort of thing illuminating? In everyday activities we often perform mechanical gestures - think of swiping an RFID card to go through a turnstile or driving a car - but everyone does them differently. In fact, the more mechanical the gesture, the more someone’s personality can be revealed. Our personality is in many ways keyed up to how we interact with the objects of the world, be it the creases left on a paperback book or the smudges on a touchscreen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a data-artist (which I define as any artist who uses a computer at some point in their work) I construct systems through which data flows and is shaped. The data-flow for one of my photographs is usually Camera Settings &amp;gt; Sensor &amp;gt; RAW file &amp;gt; Macbook &amp;gt; Lightroom &amp;gt; JPEG &amp;gt; Internet &amp;gt; Screens with each stage seeing transformations of the data. But before the photograph there’s non-electronic data flow informed by the space I’m in: the light in that space, my location and position in that space, etc. Then there’s the camera itself which radically defines the sort of photography I’m allowed to do (See &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilém_Flusser#Philosophy_of_photography&quot;&gt;Vilém Flusser&lt;/a&gt; for more on this).  And finally there’s the data-flow inside my brain leading me to decide what to photograph and how, informed by my mood, my ideas, my memories of the past and imaginations of the future. All of this is part of the system, part of the flow of making a picture. Why do we separate the human, mechanical and data parts so rigorously? Would it be interesting to blur them up a bit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, technology doesn’t dehumanise. Rather it serves as an abstraction tool to reveal the nuances of humanity. So let’s put humans in the middle of otherwise mechanical systems and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;documentation&quot;&gt;Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Echo Edit&lt;/strong&gt; was proposed as a durational performance piece in response to an &lt;a href=&quot;http://hfwas.co.uk/?p=3694&quot;&gt;open call&lt;/a&gt; for It’s Alive! put out by local performance art collective Home For Waifs And Strays and experimental film night &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/themagiccinema/&quot;&gt;Magic Cinema&lt;/a&gt; on the theme of Live Art + Cinema. &lt;a href=&quot;http://andyhowlett.co.uk&quot;&gt;Andy Howlett&lt;/a&gt;, who runs Magic Cinema, had been interested for a while in the potential of combining the spontaneity and fleshiness of live art with the premeditation and mechanically mediated atemporality of cinema (though I doubt he’d put it quite like that), resulting in a &lt;em&gt;Dream 53&lt;/em&gt;, a performance of a “lost” surrealist film for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://hfwas.co.uk/?page_id=3237&quot;&gt;Homegrown&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The open call read as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Home For Waifs and Strays are joining forces with Magic Cinema to put on an event that breaks down the boundaries between performance and film.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We are looking for short performances designed for film, live art incorporating film, cinematic performances, performance documentation, performance in dialogue with film, and any other live art/film mutation you can conceive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My proposal was this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Experience the history of cinema editing itself into a unique narrative through the medium of human gesture as artist Pete Ashton, connected to a gesture control system, allows the movies to control his movements.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;An experimental piece using the Wekinator gesture recognition programme and an archive of movie files. As a section of a film plays on the screen I will echo the movements of an actor. My movements will be recorded by the computer and translated, via Wekinator, into instructions to select which film to play next and where to start (eg, film 23 at 45 minutes in). I will then repeat my mimicry until the system is triggered and a new film starts.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The work will therefore comprise of randomly juxtaposed scenes from a wide range of films accompanied by a live human performance informed by those films. As my movements will be directly informed by the footage on the screen, the films themselves will be authoring their edits.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As part of my next body of work, Instructions for Humans, I will be developing work where humans learn from machines and vice versa. This will serve as a simple test of this concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which remarkably, given I wrote this in an evening and had no real idea if it would work, is pretty much what I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jumping to specific points in films was the hardest technical challenge. A movie is a big file, and getting a computer to load hundreds of megabytes every few seconds is a massive ask. So resized and recompressed the movie files and then sliced them into small chunks. I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://ffmpeg.org&quot;&gt;ffmpeg&lt;/a&gt; to slice the movie at every &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_frame#Video_compression&quot;&gt;keyframe&lt;/a&gt; meaning the chunks aren’t all the same length but had the advantage of usually starting at a change of shot. Here’s the ffmpeg command I used, should you ever need to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;for file in *.mp4; do mkdir clips/${file%.m4v}; ffmpeg -i ${file%.mp4}.mp4 -acodec copy -f segment -vcodec copy -reset_timestamps 1 -map 0 clips/${file%.mp4}/${file%.mp4}-%d.mp4;  done
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The logistics of movie compression are fascinating but that’s a subject for another day.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I processed some 30-odd movies, removed the credits and grouped the clips into 12 folders with 5,000 in each. (I was aiming for 100 movies but time ran out, and frankly 60,000 clips is plenty!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I threw together a quick &lt;a href=&quot;https://puredata.info&quot;&gt;PureData&lt;/a&gt; patch to load and loop each clip for a fixed number of seconds. Initially it generated two random numbers between 0 and 11 and between 1 and 5000 which combined to reference a movie clip directory and file (eg 5/2633.mp4) but random was only good for testing. I needed to bring the human in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this I used a couple of applications. The first was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wekinator.org/examples/#VideoWebcam&quot;&gt;simple webcam app&lt;/a&gt; which converted the stream to a very low-resolution 10x10 grid of blocks. This means rather than sending all the video data it just sends 100 numbers per frame which is much more manageable. It also has a really nice aesthetic. (In the screenshot below you can see the 10x10 grid in the bottom right with a normal webcam shot above it. On the right is a movie clip.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/echoedit-screenshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The webcam app sends these 100 numbers over the OSC protocol to the machine learning control application &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wekinator.org/&quot;&gt;Wekinator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wekinator is a tool for converting a fuzzy signal into a number which can be used to control another programme or instrument. For example, waving in the top-right of a webcam view can send a number to a synthesiser which triggers a high-pitched tone. There’s some good examples of Wekinator being used for musical instruments &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wekinator.org/example-projects/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wekinator is very easy to use but I had trouble getting meaningful numbers out of it, mostly because there was no meaning inherent in what I was asking it to do. I wanted particular gestures and shapes that I made to give me a number from a specific range, but that meant I either wasn’t accessing the full range of files or, worse, that any gestures I hadn’t trained for weren’t generating anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I should have done, and will do when I do this properly &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/instructions-for-humans/&quot;&gt;in August&lt;/a&gt; with Emily and Aleks, is use a machine learning system to analyse the gestures and shapes in each movie clip and assign them a reference. The same system would then analyse me on the fly and compare my reference to the database of clips, loading a similar one. That way there’d be an explicit connection between my gestures and the order of the movie clips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This didn’t happen in Echo Edit as I was effectively acting as a human random number generator, within some arbitrary ranges. Whether this was a problem or not is a very interesting question though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I performed for an hour with a couple of technical breaks and ended up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/219027996&quot;&gt;40 minutes of recorded material&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/219027996&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;359&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given I felt like I was just generating random numbers, I tried removing Wekinator from the system for the last 10 minutes (&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/219027996#t=1773s&quot;&gt;starting here&lt;/a&gt;)  and reverted to my test system where my gestures had nothing to do with the random selection of clips. To the audience this made no difference and looked exactly the same, but I was interested to know how I’d feel not being part of a loop. The knowledge that I was or wasn’t generating the number which loaded the next clip was strangely important. For the first 30 minutes my movements, however meaningless, were part of a system and therefore important. If I wasn’t there the system would just play the same clip over and over. With the computer generating random numbers to load without me I was utterly disposable and my actions pointless as well as meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I moved from thinking “I &lt;strong&gt;could be&lt;/strong&gt; replaced by a machine” to “I &lt;strong&gt;have been&lt;/strong&gt; replaced by a machine” and it felt bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m reluctant to draw any solid conclusions from this as it was mostly about the experience of performing the work and those feelings are very subjective and fluid. It’s more interesting at this stage to simple say what happened and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a USB microscope and of course the first thing I did was look at my sweaty pink beardy face. This starts at my chin and circles past the ears and across the bald wastelands. Apologies for dwelling on that curious blob of puss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A photo of Alvin Lucier is uploaded to FaceApp’s smile generator 300 times. Very quickly another face emerges. Is this the original smile?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sequel, of sorts, to &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/sitting-in-stagram/&quot;&gt;Sitting Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, inspired as ever by &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/fAxHlLK3Oyk&quot;&gt;I Am Sitting In A Room&lt;/a&gt; where Lucier recorded a recording of his voice in a room over and over until all that was left was the resonance, the echoes, of the room, revealing it’s structure through sound alone.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>R(AW)NN</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/217977340&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon seeing the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://cosmictriggerplay.com&quot;&gt;Cosmic Trigger play&lt;/a&gt; and thinking I might use &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Anton_Wilson&quot;&gt;Robert Anton Wilson&lt;/a&gt;’s approaches as a framework for making art about machine learning, I thought it apposite to push RAW’s words through a neural network and see what came out the other side. I used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.docker.com/r/crisbal/torch-rnn/&quot;&gt;torch-rnn Docker image&lt;/a&gt; and trained it on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Illuminatus!_Trilogy&quot;&gt;Illuminatus!&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrödinger%27s_Cat_Trilogy&quot;&gt;Schrödinger’s Cat&lt;/a&gt; trilogies along with some other books I could extract plain text from. I then recorded my Mac’s speech tool reading it out over eight hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, exactly the same process I used for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/goodbye-wittgenstein/&quot;&gt;Goodbye Wittgenstein&lt;/a&gt; book and audio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R(AW)NN exists in a number of formats:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hacking Choreography workshop</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I went to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://resonate.io/&quot;&gt;Resonate&lt;/a&gt; art/tech conference in Belgrade in 2017 and signed up for &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.sicchio.com&quot;&gt;Kate Sicchio&lt;/a&gt;’s Hacking Choreography workshop which, broadly, explored using coding, and coding models of thinking, to work with dance and movement. In the limited time available we produced a t-SNE piece using a piece of dance Kate performed in the space but also covered lots of interesting ideas around scoring dance and the overlap of instruction for movement and coding computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of the things I learned in this workshop fed into &lt;a href=&quot;https://art.peteashton.com/instructions-for-humans/&quot;&gt;Instructions for Humans&lt;/a&gt;, specifically the piece &lt;a href=&quot;https://art.peteashton.com/data-cult/&quot;&gt;Data Cult&lt;/a&gt; with Emily Warner and Aleks Wojtulewicz, via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://art.peteashton.com/echo_edit/&quot;&gt;Echo Edit&lt;/a&gt; experimental piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;t-sne-kate&quot;&gt;t-SNE Kate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;t-SNE is sorting algorithm that can be coupled with image classification to map images according to their similarity. We all created a t-SNE cloud of Kate’s movements. Here are mine. (Click for bigger.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/hacking_choreography_tsne.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/hacking_choreography_tsne.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;animations&quot;&gt;Animations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The t-SNE was made with PNG files with transparent backgrounds, which when put into an animation (such as a GIF) will stack on top of each other, creating time-trails. This wasn’t part of the workshop - just a fun thing I did in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Delightful Impossibility of Cityscapes</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/201191882&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A talk given for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://kingsnortonphotographicsociety.com&quot;&gt;Kings Norton Photography Society&lt;/a&gt; in south Birmingham on 25th January 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They asked me to talk about photographing cities and I took the opportunity to introduce a relatively traditional but open-minded group of photographes to some new developments in computational photography. It was a lot of fun and helped me nail a new concepts I’d been working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many works shown can be found in Nicholas Felton’s book &lt;a href=&quot;http://photoviz.tumblr.com&quot;&gt;Photoviz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pictures from Dorian Gray</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Pictures_From_Dorian_Gray_6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been exploring the potential of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix&quot;&gt;pix2pix&lt;/a&gt; system for generating photos from abstract representations of objects. A popular version of this currently buzzing around the internet is &lt;a href=&quot;http://affinelayer.com/pixsrv/index.html&quot;&gt;edges2cats&lt;/a&gt;, because cats, and more interesting work is being done by &lt;a href=&quot;http://mario-klingemann.tumblr.com&quot;&gt;Mario Klingemann&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic principle is fairly simple. You create a pair of images. One is the original image and the other is an abstraction, usually an outline. You then train a neural network to try to generate the original from the abstraction. This is analogous to teaching a child to recognise dogs. You show it lots of pictures of different dogs labelled “dog” and eventually the child will correctly identify a dog even if it’s never seen that specific dog before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pix2pixexamples.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve trained the system, you can then give it abstractions and ask it to figure out the “original”. In theory it produces something that looks real, which is the goal of these systems. In practice it’s very easy to produce something that looks weird and interesting, which is why artists have latched on to this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as the joy of producing weird images, I’m interested in exploring what’s actually happening in these systems by poking them with sticks. I was drawn to &lt;a href=&quot;http://mario-klingemann.tumblr.com/post/157270869090/yhancik-mario-klingemann-trained-pix2pix-with&quot;&gt;Mario’s use of blurred abstractions&lt;/a&gt; to create an oil-paint effect and wondered what other sorts of abstractions could be used. Since some of my work has involved transforming between mediums (&lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/live-sonification-photography/&quot;&gt;image to sound&lt;/a&gt;, etc) I thought I’d give &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art&quot;&gt;ASCII Art&lt;/a&gt; a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used a collection of “classic photography” I’d found a while back as my training data and produced ASCII versions of each picture using the process included in Apple’s Automator app. Here’s an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/training-1-photo-0003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ASCII here is quite fine and uses all the possible characters, which wasn’t giving me the abstraction I needed, so I went with &lt;a href=&quot;https://csl.name/jp2a/&quot;&gt;jp2a&lt;/a&gt; which gave me a lot more control. Specifically I could up the font size and chose which characters it used. By limiting it to lower-case a-z and select punctuation I was able to generate this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/training-2-photo-0003.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the abstraction looks closer to real text, the sort you might get in a book that makes sense. This is what I was after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the training underway I started to prepare my input for the final piece. I needed a body of text and settled on the Gutenberg edition of Oscar Wilde’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4078&quot;&gt;The Picture of Dorian Gray&lt;/a&gt; because one should always go for the pun, but any text would do. I removed all paragraphs and extraneous spacing and exported it into squares which resembled the generated ASCII art. Here’s the first page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dorian_sq_01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the training had finished processing overnight (it’s a long process, though my electricity usage plug says it only cost 24p for 12 hours, which isn’t bad) I asked it to generate photos from all 91 pages. Here’s that first page again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dorian_sq_01-after.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here’s all the pages in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/205563393&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;padding:100% 0 0 0;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/205563393&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also &lt;a href=&quot;/images/Pictures_From_Dorian_Gray.pdf&quot;&gt;download it as a PDF&lt;/a&gt; if you like.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>SIMULACRAMOMA</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;SIMULACRAMOMA is a playful look at object recognition systems, asking them to dive deep into modern art paintings from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.moma.org/collection/&quot;&gt;MOMA collection&lt;/a&gt;. Usually throttled to a respectable degree of certainty, the algorithm has been set free to interpret each paint stroke or shape it thinks it recognises. Sadly my poor robot has never seen such abstract art before, having trained on a more representational data set, and while it may find meaning in these artefacts of modernity, it can only be articulated in the blandest terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work comprises a selection of famous paintings from the MOMA collection which have been passed through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/&quot;&gt;Darknet YOLO object detection system&lt;/a&gt; with a excessively low tolerance of 0.001. The output is a render of the painting with hundreds of objects recognised, very few of which a human would notice, marked with the traditional crude bounding boxes and labels. The original painting has been defaced to the point of incoherence with occasional features popping out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work lives as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://flic.kr/s/aHskSVjQp1&quot;&gt;Flickr set&lt;/a&gt; of 517 pieces. Here are five.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Show and Tell was a short-lived monthly meetup for artists run at &lt;a href=&quot;http://artefactstirchley.co.uk&quot;&gt;Artefact&lt;/a&gt; in Stirchley, south Birmingham, to talk with peers about any problems they were having with their work. Groups ran from 2 to 10 people and it turns out everyone has the same problems!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put it on hold while Instructions for Humans was running and then developed it into the on-going Stirchley Salon format.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Experimental Capture workshop for BOM</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/workshops_BOM.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bom.org.uk/event/artandtech-pete-ashton/&quot;&gt;Experimental Capture workshop&lt;/a&gt; was part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://bom.org.uk&quot;&gt;Birmingham Open Media&lt;/a&gt; (BOM)’s Art &amp;amp; Tech Social strand where artists and technologists shared some learning to the public over curry and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOM had supported by trip to &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/levin-exp-cap/&quot;&gt;Golan Levin’s Experimental Capture workshop&lt;/a&gt; earlier in the year as part of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/bom-fellowship/&quot;&gt;Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; on the understanding that I would share what I’d learned with the local community, so this was also the formal part of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subjects covered included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slo-mo and time-lapse&lt;/strong&gt;. Seeing how we can control time to illuminate change.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photogrammetry.&lt;/strong&gt; Extracting 3D models of objects from simple video.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternative wavelengths.&lt;/strong&gt; Exploring how recording infra-red, ultraviolet, heat and radio waves can be used in artistic documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depth sensors.&lt;/strong&gt; Using the gaming tool Kinect to record distance alongside colour.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After Hockney.&lt;/strong&gt; Using photo-merge and montage to represent many moments in one image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>The Droids</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/thedroids.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Droids&lt;/strong&gt; was comissioned by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fermynwoods.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Fermynwoods&lt;/a&gt; as part of their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fermynwoods.co.uk/current-programme/open-online-six/&quot;&gt;Open Online Six&lt;/a&gt; for 2016, an online-only exhibition. The subject is “Too Long For iTunes: Challenging the limits of online presentation and exploring offline digital culture” referencing an intriguing situation in digital distribuion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Terre Thaemlitz’s 2011 album Soulnessless included a nearly 30-hour piano solo filling a single maximum length 320kB/s MP3 file of 4GB – yet the file playback [on iTunes] was limited to the first two hours and 40 minutes! Challenging the era’s dominant media format the album was sold only as a 16GB microSDHD card, drawing a distinction between online culture and digital culture, honouring the authors ‘specificity of content’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peteash10/Artworks/master/images/toolong_yes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Droids takes a piece of copyrighted and highly protected film footage – “These are not the droids you’re looking for” from Star Wars - and re-encodes it over and over so that the video and audio slowly degraded to incoherent digital mush. Each itteration is then uploaded to YouTube and only some of them are caught by the ContentID algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work looks for the edge cases in our emerging algorithmic police state; searching for the points where a copyright infringement evades the pattern-matching robots running algorithms searching for copyrighted material. These edges will shift throughout the exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peteash10/Artworks/master/images/toolong_no.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRW0vU-u-9qZmjtWj8RUWY-4szXBWQU2y&quot;&gt;The work exists as a playlist on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; under the account Too Long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/148619063&quot;&gt;Here’s a promo video&lt;/a&gt; which shows the edge as is stood in December 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 1st, when the exhibition opened, the first 50 or so videos were blocked but the remaining were passed. As of September all the videos are available to watch. It’ll be interesting to see if the enforcement pickes up again future Star Wars films are released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fermynwoods.org/fermynwoods-friday-16-the-droids/&quot;&gt;Fermynwoods posted a look-back on their blog in May 2018.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fuck Your Flags</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/193939679&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;359&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I come back to the UK through customs I always note the indignity of sorting human beings into groups. The way harried border staff impose arbitrary legislation on foreign nationals for no real benefit is embarrassing. The whole thing makes me wish for a world without borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 1st December 2016 I was traveling into the UK. A few months previous, Brexit had happened. While I was away Trump had won the election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/193939679&quot;&gt;Fuck Your Flags&lt;/a&gt; was made that night. It uses crude pixel-sorting algorithms to turn the flags of the world into bands of colour. The programme picks a pixel at random, compares it to its neighbour and swaps it so that the brighter one is on the left. And so on, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some countries these icons are sacred. Fuck that.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>20/20 Visions</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/kwmc.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twentytwentyvisions.org.uk/artists/pete-ashton/&quot;&gt;My New Camera Is A Laser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is an essay comissioned by &lt;a href=&quot;http://kwmc.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Knowle West Media Centre&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://twentytwentyvisions.org.uk/&quot;&gt;20/20 Visions: Re-Valuing Photography, People And Place&lt;/a&gt; to mark their &lt;a href=&quot;http://kwmc.org.uk/projects/kwmc20/&quot;&gt;20th anniversary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What it means to make a “photograph” has undergone such a seismic disruption over the last couple of decades that the term is almost meaningless. We can say that a camera is a chamber into which reflected light is allowed to enter under controlled conditions (lens focus, aperture size, shutter time), but after that pretty much everything is up for grabs. How the light is recorded and in what format, how that information (analogue or digital) is processed and how the resulting image is distributed and displayed – all these choices have grown exponentially as computing power and access to technology has expanded our ability to make and consume images. You might even say you don’t need a camera at all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;As such I’m not really sure what a photograph is anymore. Maybe photography is just the initial capture of light in a place and time, supplying the raw material for what we might call “image production” or “visual data manipulation”. Or maybe there are photographs but they don’t exist in isolation. They’re part of the “stream”, juxtaposed thoughtfully, algorithmically or randomly with each other and the surrounding world.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;When I think about visual culture it’s this mass of images, and how we might process them, which comes to mind: visual art as data, zeros and ones which can be churned by a computer. This is where the power lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twentytwentyvisions.org.uk/artists/pete-ashton/&quot;&gt;Read on…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/peteash10/kwmc/blob/master/README.md&quot;&gt;References and further reading can be found in this appendix.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Melissa Mean for comissioning the work and indulging my speculations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Goodbye Wittgenstein</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wiggydreammap.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pete Ashton&lt;br /&gt;
November 2016&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://qujochoe.org/goodbye-wittgenstein-part-2/&quot;&gt;Goodbye Wittgenstein&lt;/a&gt; is an ongoing collaborative project between the &lt;a href=&quot;http://qujochoe.org/&quot;&gt;qujOchÖ&lt;/a&gt; artist collective in Linz, Austria and &lt;a href=&quot;http://a3projectspace.org/&quot;&gt;A3 Project Space&lt;/a&gt; in Birmingham, UK. Along with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.podprojects.org/&quot;&gt;Trevor Pitt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://emily-warner.com/&quot;&gt;Emily Warner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://mikeinmono.blogspot.co.at/&quot;&gt;Mike Johnston&lt;/a&gt;, I was invited by A3 to join a month-long residency at &lt;a href=&quot;http://salzamt-linz.at&quot;&gt;Atelierhaus Salzamt&lt;/a&gt;, a residential studio in central Linz, to produce work responding to the philosopher &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein&quot;&gt;Ludwig Wittgenstein&lt;/a&gt;’s time in Linz and Birmingham. An exhibition of our work opened on November 23rd 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wittgenstein-wandelt-wehmütig-widriger-winde-wegen-wienwärts&quot;&gt;Wittgenstein wandelt wehmütig widriger winde wegen Wienwärts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his residency at Salzamt for the Goodbye Wittgenstein project, &lt;a href=&quot;http://peteashton.com&quot;&gt;Pete Ashton&lt;/a&gt; has been exploring Linz using the phrase Ludwig Wittgenstein was taunted with by fellow students at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realschule&quot;&gt;Realschule&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Steingasse+6,+4020+Linz,+Austria/@48.3014441,14.2823591,17z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x4773978359e3cb37:0xab3d3afc3c5598b4!2sSteingasse,+4020+Linz,+Austria!3b1!8m2!3d48.3014441!4d14.2845478!3m4!1s0x47739784a26ff2d9:0x8a1c2f3a873bf958!8m2!3d48.3020645!4d14.2856296?hl=en&quot;&gt;Steingasse&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Wittgenstein wandelt wehmütig widriger winde wegen Wienwärts&lt;/em&gt; (“Wittgenstein strolls wistfully Vienna-wards due to adverse winds”. Finding the direction of Vienna from the school, Ashton proceeded to walk as Wittgenstein might have, wistfully taking in this sample of historic, residential, municipal and industrial Linz, until hitting the Danube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peteash10/Goodbye-Wittgenstein/master/stuff/WWWWWWWWalk_route_map.png&quot; alt=&quot;The route across Linz&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work in the exhibition, across three walls, showcases attempts to represent this journey, and Wittgenstein’s relationship Linz, in a variety of ways, many explored for the first time during the residency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peteash10/Goodbye-Wittgenstein/master/stuff/_DSC5718.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the left is a black line tracing the route walked  from Steingasse to the Danube. The taunt is framed above the school and as we away it is translated to English (correctly and badly), ASCII, hexadecimal, octal and finally the pure noise of binary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the centre is a large &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/192942535&quot;&gt;video projection&lt;/a&gt; of 1 minute static views from 36 points along the route. The early scenes are busy and unfocussed, leading to calmer, sharper scenes through the industrial areas (farmlands in Wittgenstein’s day) until reaching the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peteash10/Goodbye-Wittgenstein/master/stuff/_DSC5710.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the right are two algorithmic works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/30969130495/in/album-72157672997179104/&quot;&gt;automatic merging&lt;/a&gt; of 86 photographs taken by Ashton during walks along the route on November 9th, along with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/30487606753/in/album-72157672997179104/&quot;&gt;charcoal rendering&lt;/a&gt;. The image is authored by &lt;a href=&quot;https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/combine-images-auto-blend-layers.html&quot;&gt;Photoshop’s Auto Blend algorithm&lt;/a&gt;, a tool designed for focus-stacking and panorama stitching but used here on wildly differing images. The algorithm looks for the sharpest, boldest areas of the photos and combines them into a visually chaotic but mathematically ordered image. The charcoal rendering is produced by hand-tracing the projected digital image in the manner of a mechanical plotter or printer, submitting human creativity to the rule of the machine. Errors in the rendering are the result of glitches in the human-machine interface. Both these works are experiments in post-photographic realisations of camera-captured data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next to this is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lulu.com/shop/pete-ashton/wittgenstein-wandelt-wehmütig-widriger-winde-wegen-wienwärts/hardcover/product-22963804.html&quot;&gt;hardcover publication&lt;/a&gt; of text generated with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jcjohnson/torch-rnn&quot;&gt;torch-rnn&lt;/a&gt; neural network trained on Wittgenstein’s extant writings, seeded with the childhood taunt, creating original text using mathematical logic. The process is similar to the predictive text system on smartphones and has produced prose which, while utterly nonsensical, evokes the rhythm and feel of Wittgenstein’s original work. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/589r5fyt6ifldxh/Wiggy-RNN-Dictation-German.mp3?dl=0&quot;&gt;audio recording&lt;/a&gt; of Apple’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoiceOver&quot;&gt;VoiceOver&lt;/a&gt; accessibility system reading the text as if it were German increases the nonsense quotient and references qujOchÖ’s &lt;em&gt;Meaning of Dictation&lt;/em&gt; from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://qujochoe.org/goodbye-wittgenstein/&quot;&gt;original Goodbye Wittgenstien project&lt;/a&gt; in Birmingham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peteash10/Goodbye-Wittgenstein/master/stuff/_DSC5735.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://peteashton.com&quot;&gt;Pete Ashton&lt;/a&gt; is a multimedia artist creating transformative site-specific work. His practice explores the role of cameras as post-photographic data-capture devices, amongst other things. He’s an inaugural fellow at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bom.org.uk&quot;&gt;Birmingham Open Media&lt;/a&gt;, a collaborative workspace at the intersection of art, technology and science. He lives In Birmingham, NW Europe, with his wife, &lt;a href=&quot;http://fionacullinan.com&quot;&gt;Fiona&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/bunminster/&quot;&gt;three rabbits&lt;/a&gt;, Bunminster Fuller, Clementine and Joy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Portrait of Birmingham</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/portrait-bham.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Portrait of Birmingham&lt;/strong&gt; is a record of a walk across the city in a straight line, from one Outer Circle bus stop to its opposite number, photographed at five second intervals from a chest mounted camera. The photographs have been sliced into 12 squares and arranged by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding&quot;&gt;t-SNE&lt;/a&gt; sorting algorithm and a neural network trained to recognise the contents of images, resulting in a taxonomy for a core sample of the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work uses artificial intelligence algorithms to interrogate the visual identity of a modern post-industrial suburban city and builds on the psychographical work &lt;a href=&quot;http://xcw.org.uk&quot;&gt;Cross City Walks&lt;/a&gt; developed by the artist in collaboration with Andy Howlett. As a whole it challenges the traditional notion of a city landscape and employs the otherwise mundane features to collectively represent the city from street level. The algorithmic sorting creates pockets of comparison, echoing the Typologies of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/bernd-becher-and-hilla-becher-718&quot;&gt;Bernd and Hilla Becher&lt;/a&gt;, revealing the subtle differences across similar features, while glitches and edge-cases create amusing juxtapositions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work can be displayed as a giant print or as a projector or screen-based “map” interface. Each square should be at least 1cm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An online version of the work &lt;a href=&quot;https://artworks.peteashton.com/tsne-xcw2/&quot;&gt;can be viewed here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interactive installation of &lt;strong&gt;A Portrait of Birmingam&lt;/strong&gt; was exhibited as part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vividprojects.org.uk/programme/black-hole-club-launch/&quot;&gt;Black Hole Club 2017 launch at Vivid Projects&lt;/a&gt;, Friday 3rd March 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>t-SNE</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;t-SNE, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding&quot;&gt;t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding&lt;/a&gt;, is is a machine learning algorithm for visualization where similar objects are modeled by nearby points and dissimilar objects are modeled by distant points. In other words, it finds similar looking things and clusters them together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;t-SNE was an entry-level demo during the Machine Learning Arts gold-rush because it could be relatively easily run on a laptop and produced a nice visual result. It also served to answer the question “what can we do with all these bloody images we’re generating?” We can stick them in a t-SNE grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I found with t-SNE is it’s very good at dealing with single objects but gets muddy when there are many things in an image, as is the case with most normal photographs, so I started to chop photos into smaller squares, usually 6 or 12 pieces, and put those through the system. This seemed to give me more consistent clusters while the increase in density made for a more impressionistic canvas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main piece of t-SNE work from this period is &lt;a href=&quot;https://art.peteashton.com/portrait-bham&quot;&gt;A Portrait of Birmingham&lt;/a&gt; but there were of course many experiments which I keep in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/albums/72157673603497335&quot;&gt;a Flickr album&lt;/a&gt;, many of which rework image collections from other works of mine.

        <title>Foot Camera</title>

&lt;p&gt;Foot Camera was an experiment in extending the body camera to other areas. The long term plan was to attach cameras to many articulation points on my body and play them back simultaneously in a gallery, but that never came to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The walk was Laura Oldfield Ford’s group walk for her residency at Grand Union, looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Saltley_Gate&quot;&gt;Battle of Saltly Gate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/648-mps-all-merged.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;an &lt;a href=&quot;http://peteashton.com/art&quot;&gt;Art&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://peteashton.com&quot;&gt;Pete Ashton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diversity in leadership across all areas is an issue, no-one but the biggest wanker would dispute that, but it only really hit home when I took all the photos of the UK members of parliament from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/&quot;&gt;official index&lt;/a&gt; and merged them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this sort of mass average always produces a result like with no nuance, and it’s fairly easy to dismiss, so I merged each MP with 19 of their peers, after randomly sorting them, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/173485602&quot;&gt;put these in a video&lt;/a&gt;, intended to be displayed on a screen in public. (If anyone would like to display it on a screen in public, please get in touch.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, here’s just the female MPs:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Golan Levin's Experimental Capture Workshop</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/golan-expcap-ir.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d been following the work of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flong.com&quot;&gt;Golan Levin&lt;/a&gt; for a while and as part of my research for the Speculative Cameras project I decided to attend his &lt;a href=&quot;http://golancourses.net/capture2016/&quot;&gt;Experimental Capture summer school&lt;/a&gt; in 2016. Based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture&quot;&gt;his course&lt;/a&gt; at Carnegie Melon’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://studioforcreativeinquiry.org&quot;&gt;Studio for Creative Inquiry&lt;/a&gt; it promised access to “capture devices” that went beyond cameras with a world-class digital artist as our guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The week-long course took place at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.andersonranch.org&quot;&gt;Anderson Ranch&lt;/a&gt; in the Colorado mountains, which made it a bit of an ask to attend, but I received a scholarship from them to cover my fees and a £200 towards my flight from Birmingham Open Media (in return for &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/bom-art-tech-social/&quot;&gt;sharing the knowledge&lt;/a&gt; upon my return), which made it do-able.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programme (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/golanlevin/ExperimentalCapture/blob/56314f6f367423e2ed32dd38d5b5904e92ff1e3b/workshop/README.md&quot;&gt;archived here&lt;/a&gt;) was packed and intensive, covering the full spectrum (no pun intended):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Photogrammetry and 3D scanning&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Multi-spectral imaging (NIR, UV, Thermal)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High-speed videography&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;360-degree video&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Time play&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gesture capture &amp;amp; OSC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Golan gave short lectures on the artistic application of these tools, both in and of themselves and as triggers for interactivity, through the history of contemporary art and where that overlapped with technology demos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had an opportunity to play with the tools as part of our practice and concluded the week presenting a new artwork to the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gesture-capture--osc&quot;&gt;Gesture capture &amp;amp; OSC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My final piece was a LiDAR musical instrument, capturing movement in the room and sending it to a PureData synth programme via OSC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Art in Crisis was a project run by homelessness charity &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crisis.org.uk&quot;&gt;Crisis&lt;/a&gt; and arts organisation &lt;a href=&quot;http://bom.org.uk&quot;&gt;Birmingham Open Media (BOM)&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which I was a Fellow with. Three BOM Fellows, including myself, worked with Crisis clients to document their experiences. The resulting works, made in collaboration with them, were presented in the BOM gallery for a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked with John, Gareth and Alan, walking with cameras around Digbeth which they photographed from their perspective. We reviewed and discussed what to do with the photos and I produced the following three videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kateself.com/art-crisis-festival-2016/&quot;&gt;A symposium on the project&lt;/a&gt; was arranged by Kate Self, taking place at Eastside Projects, where I spoke briefly about the work. The videos were also screened as part of the Open Air Cinema at the Art in Crisis Festival on 23rd July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you want to give a talk on a subject but you can’t quite structure a talk from the subject in the way you’re supposed to, so you just give an unstructured talk and see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making it Matter was a talk I gave for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://randomstring.co&quot;&gt;Random String&lt;/a&gt; conference in Coventry on June 10th 2016. Random String is an arts conference concentrating on technology and involves a number of my peers from the West Midlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to talk about the ethical and moral struggles and compromises necessary when working with technology. This is, of course, a massive thing, but I felt it was important for these issues to be raised at a technology conference where speakers tend to be understandably positive and optimistic about the tools they’re using in their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the talk went down OK. I had some nice feedback afterwards. But as a “performance” it’s very lacking. A few years later I discovered the problem is it doesn’t obey the Monoform, which &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.peteashton.com/1543358484&quot;&gt;I wrote about here&lt;/a&gt;. The Monoform could also be called the Varnished Truth, where all the unfortunate, difficult bits are smoothed out to leave a perfect, coherent statement. But truth isn’t coherent, and art is messy, so maybe we need less varnish at our conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, looking back on this talk in 2019 I’m quite impressed at how I started to articulate some of these points. I was definitely on to something and I’m sure I could do a better go at it now, should anyone want to give me a stage and half an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Koyaanisqatsi Slitscanned</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/koyaanisqatsi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slitscanning is a photographic technique that was originally achieved using a mechanical attachment to a film camera. As images are now pixels which can be manipulated using maths, the potential of slit-scanning has grown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use slit-scanning to attempt to represent sequences of moments all at once by taking a core sample of pixels from each one and stacking them together. Doing this across a movie file, such as the iconic Koyaanisqatsi, starting at the far left and moving to the right, alows us to experience the film in a new way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/165126256?byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A movie exists in three dimensions. Vertical, horizontal and through time. In slitscanning I swap the vertical for the temporal. Or to put it another way, imagine putting all the frames of a film in a rolodex and then slicing the rolodex in a bacon slicer. That’s sort of what’s going on here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

        <title>Speculative Cameras at BOM</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Speculative Cameras was my research project as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/bom-fellowship/&quot;&gt;Birmingham Open Media Fellow&lt;/a&gt; in 2016. It tied together a number of things I’d been thinking about to do with cameras and while it didn’t conclude with anything concrete it has fed into nearly all my work since. There were two talks given, the first as part of the BOM Fellows exhibition and the second at a Pecha Kucha event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/159868781&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/159211005&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BOM Fellows exhibition was titled Live R&amp;amp;D and saw me putting all my research on a wall, inviting the public to help me make sense of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/bom-spec-cam-wall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also attempted to build a new camera inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alfonsschilling.net&quot;&gt;Alfons Schilling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/352537760?autoplay=1&amp;amp;loop=1&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;361&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

        <title>Spinning Logos</title>

&lt;p&gt;In 2016 I was “invited” to work with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Birdseye&quot;&gt;Käpt’n Iglo&lt;/a&gt; brand by an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zooppa.com&quot;&gt;agency’s database&lt;/a&gt; which had been mislead as to the substance of my work. I decided to play along as if it were a serious commission and produced a piece of work reminiscent of existing work, specifically &lt;a href=&quot;https://art.peteashton.com/spinning-room/&quot;&gt;Spinning in a Room&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://art.peteashton.com/supper-room/&quot;&gt;Supper Room&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I submitted the Käpt’n Iglo logo rotating into digital mush to their platform and heard nothing back. I then gave seven other corporate sigils the same treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/spinning-logos-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/spinning-logos-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/spinning-logos-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be remiss of me not to mention m’learned friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hellocatfood.com/&quot;&gt;Antonio Roberts&lt;/a&gt;’ project &lt;a href=&quot;https://copyrightatrophy.tumblr.com&quot;&gt;Copyright Atrophy&lt;/a&gt; which was doubtless an inspiration for this piece&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sketching Obscura Cabinet</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/sketching-obscura-cabinet_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sketching Obscura Cabinet was commissioned from &lt;a href=&quot;http://bhamobscura.com&quot;&gt;Birmingham Obscura&lt;/a&gt; (Jenny Duffin and myself) by the Mead Gallery for the educational room accompanying their exhibition of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.warwickartscentre.co.uk/whats-on/2016/gerard-byrne-1125-of-a-second/&quot;&gt;Gerald Byrne’s work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was built from a standard cabinet with a hole cut in the door for the lens, a mirror positioned at 45 degrees inside and frosted perspex on the top onto which the light was focussed. Participants sat in front of it and leaned into a light-proof cloak on the top, seeing an image of the scene in front of them. They could then place tracing paper over it and copy the image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The device worked but unfortunately the lighting in the room was not very bright so the image was pretty dim. It would have worked much better outside, of course!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The education room itself was curated by &lt;a href=&quot;http://jogane.co.uk&quot;&gt;Jo Gane&lt;/a&gt; and the graphics accompanying the device were by &lt;a href=&quot;http://kerryleslie.com&quot;&gt;Kerry Leslie&lt;/a&gt; (who is under the cloak in these pictures).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Trailblazers</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe title=&quot;vimeo-player&quot; src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/164324550&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/trailblazers.html&quot;&gt;Trailblazers&lt;/a&gt; was an attempt by Birmingham City Council to survey the opinions of early-teen schoolchildren about the city and its future. Rather than send out questionnaires they commissioned &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stanscafe.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Stan’s Cafe&lt;/a&gt;, a theatre company with a strong educational programme, to run it in their own way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project ran in three broad stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, 20 schools selected 6 pupils aged 14-15. They were taken on two walks by a photographer and an artist facilitator. The first walk was around their school and local area, which they should know well. The second walk was in another part of Birmingham which they had not visited before. This second location was chosen by them by exploring an A-Z map before the walks. Afterwards they were interviewed in pairs about the walks, using the photographs as prompts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, all 120 pupils met at the Council House in central Birmingham where they took on the role of a councillor, sitting in the chamber, making speeches and voting on resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, all their photos, opinions and other materials generated were collaged into a new map of Birmingham by artist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.garethcourage.co.uk&quot;&gt;Gareth Courage&lt;/a&gt; which was printed in the style of an Ordnance Survey map and distributed to every elected councillor, each school and other interested parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was hired as a photographer to devise and lead about half of the walks and to document the council meeting. I also produced some side-works with the thousands of photographs generated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was one of the most rewarding jobs I’ve had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/trailblazers-kids-01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-map&quot;&gt;The Map&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designed by Gareth Courage from photos taken on the walks and quotes from the students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;t-sne-grid&quot;&gt;t-SNE grid&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year or so later I asked a t-SNE algorithm to sort the photos according to identified objects and it produced this massive grid. Click here to explore it in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;instabeck&quot;&gt;InstaBeck&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by &lt;a href=&quot;http://peteashton.com&quot;&gt;Pete Ashton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peteash10/Artworks/master/images/Instabeck-1024x896.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was delighted to be chosen by &lt;a href=&quot;http://jogane.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Jo Gane&lt;/a&gt; to exhibit at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bom.org.uk/event/the-jhb-archive/&quot;&gt;The JHB Archive&lt;/a&gt;, her group show at Birmingham Open Media running from Sept 11th to Oct 3rd 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the pieces are inspired by the scant information on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/peteash10/Artworks/blob/master/Instabeck/Submission%20brief.pdf&quot;&gt;the archival record for a missing sculpture&lt;/a&gt;, reverse-engineering the metadata into art, if you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My piece continues work taking core samples of photographic images from social sharing networks which I first developed with the &lt;strong&gt;IMG_4228&lt;/strong&gt; series. I started with the text of the archive record itself which I split into 7 lines of 8 words each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;abstract sculpture by julian h beck rectangular mahogany&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;type walnut according to sculptor marked 25 in&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;paint near base two roundhead screws for attachment&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;to plinth on regtangular plinth covered in black&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tape inside of plinth marked 23 1961 or&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;28 1961 number painted out and replaced by&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;new number see press cuttings file and minutes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peteash10/Artworks/master/images/InstaBeck%200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put each word / letter / number into Instagram as a hashtag and saved the first eight images that came up. I then put these into a couple of grids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peteash10/Artworks/master/images/InstaBeck%201.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peteash10/Artworks/master/images/InstaBeck%202.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsatisfied with how these looked, I cropped each image to its central pixel (finding the average colour simply produces a lot of grey/brown) and resized them back up to 200x200px, giving a nice clean field of colour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final stage was to randomise the image. For this I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://puredata.info/&quot;&gt;PureData&lt;/a&gt;, writing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/peteash10/Artworks/blob/master/Instabeck/Installation%20code%20and%20images/instabeck.pd&quot;&gt;the following patch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/peteash10/Artworks/blob/master/Instabeck/Installation%20code%20and%20images/instabeck.pd&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peteash10/Artworks/master/images/Instabeck%20PD%20patch.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which no doubt looks terrifying, but it’s actually pretty simple. Each of these…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peteash10/Artworks/master/images/instabeck-patch-zoom.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…builds a square representing a word/letter/number from the description, and all the lines coming into that bit randomises which colour is shown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To pre-load the work you hit the orange button, then the green button launches the video changing a square every second, though the speed can be changed using the blue buttons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over in the top-right is an optional bit of code which uses the computer’s microphone to alter the speed, so a noisy room will produce a frenetic display while silence will freeze it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/138805236&quot;&gt;Here’s a video&lt;/a&gt; of it is in situ during testing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/138805236&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peteash10/Artworks/master/images/Instabeck%20Vimeo.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for most of the exhibition a pre-recorded loop can run to save electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By a happy co-incidence the work bears a striking similarity to one of Beck’s own paintings and Jo sent me a photo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peteash10/Artworks/master/images/Instabeck%20Beck%20Painting.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;photo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Birmingham Obscura R&amp;D Artworks</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the winter of 2015-16, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bhamobscura.com/&quot;&gt;Birmingham Obscura&lt;/a&gt; project, being Jenny Duffin and myself, recruited four other artists via open call to propose new artworks to be made with our recently built camera obscura. We took their proposals and successful received an R&amp;amp;D grant from the Arts Council to produce them, with the long-term intention of discovering how the camera obscura could be used by artists in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Documentation and videos are available at these links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bhamobscura.com/artworks/upside-down/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://bhamobscura.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/05/Upside-Front.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cross City Walk Treadmill</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/xcw-flatpack.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the never ending attempt to make sense of the photographs taken during the &lt;a href=&quot;http://xcw.org.uk&quot;&gt;Cross City Walks&lt;/a&gt;, Andy Howlett and I proposed &lt;a href=&quot;http://flatpackfestival.org.uk/event/cross-city-walks/&quot;&gt;an interative movie for 2015’s Flatpack Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; alongside the &lt;a href=&quot;https://videostrolls.com/2015/03/01/video-strolls-at-flatpack-film-festival/&quot;&gt;Video Strolls&lt;/a&gt; programme of walking-related films. The installation was realised on a zero budget in the derelict attic of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://centrala-space.org.uk&quot;&gt;Centrala&lt;/a&gt; cafe in a coverted Digbeth industrial space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film was a simple slideslow of the photos taken by a chest-mounted GoPro camera. By walking on a treadmill people could control the speed of the film as they walked across an ersatz Birmingham projected in front on them on a giant five by three metre screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/123459255&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The installation was accompanied by &lt;a href=&quot;http://xcw.org.uk/flatpack-festival-installation-2015/forward/&quot;&gt;an essay by Andy&lt;/a&gt; and I later wrote up some &lt;a href=&quot;http://xcw.org.uk/towards-a-theory-of-cross-city-walks/&quot;&gt;reflections on the experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would be very interested in doing something similar with an actual budget involving money and equipment that works properly.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Watchmen, by Brightness</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/watchmen-by-brightness-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Someone has a LOT of time on their hands” - &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davegibbons90/status/595678823833849857&quot;&gt;Dave Gibbons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The comic book &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen&quot;&gt;Watchmen&lt;/a&gt;, by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, came out in 1987 when I was just getting into comics as a teenager. It therefore defined what comics were and could be for me, for better or worse. Watchmen is a very formal work, exploring the potential of the medium through what is, upon reflection, a pretty standard mystery story. Many of the panels echo other panels, inviting the reader to make connections across contexts, pushing the non-linear visual nature of reading a comic as opposed to watching a film. (This is, of course, one reason why the 2009 film was so pointless, not to mention shit, because it fundamentally misunderstood what it was attempting to adapt. But I digress.) It also uses a strict 9 panel grid with all panels obeying this ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2015 I was at a talk by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nicolasnova.net&quot;&gt;Nicolas Nova&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nearfuturelaboratory.com&quot;&gt;New Future Lab&lt;/a&gt; where he talked about many things including, according to my notes, “syncing up photos based on metadata, not just location but time of day, etc.” The idea of juxtaposing images based on differing criteria caught my attention and made me think of comics, the ultimate in juxtaposed narrative, and formalist games like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scottmccloud.com/4-inventions/nancy/index.html&quot;&gt;Five Card Nancy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I got a digital copy of Watchmen and chopped each page into its constituent panels. I then ran some code which sorted them by their brightness and produced a web page which lays out the panels in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://artworks.peteashton.com/watchmen/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can view the web page here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Let it load (it’s a good 60 MB) and it should format into a tight grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started work on reconstructing the panels into a book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://watchmenbybrightness.tumblr.com&quot;&gt;serialising it on Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, but only got 2/3 of the way through. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/z7uuvhyg3l4sz9f/Watchmen%20by%20Brightness.pdf?dl=1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can download the incomplete book here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (500 MB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who knows Watchmen very well, I find this new arrangement fascinating. A future development might be Random Watchmen, which automatically generates unique copies of the comic on demand. Maybe one day, once I finish this version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/watchmen-by-brightness-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/watchmen-by-brightness-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/watchmen-by-brightness-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/watchmen-by-brightness-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/watchmen-by-brightness-6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/48561453406/&quot;&gt;the Watchmen panels sorted by the t-SNE algorithm&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://art.peteashton.com/tsne/&quot;&gt;more info&lt;/a&gt;) which looks for visual similarities. I really should make a readable version of this too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Flatpack Film Festival Camera Obscura installation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While we waited for the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/bhamobscura-2/&quot;&gt;Birmingham Camera Obscura&lt;/a&gt; to be built, Jenny Duffin and I put together a small obscura installation for the 2015 &lt;a href=&quot;https://flatpackfestival.org.uk&quot;&gt;Flatpack Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;. We constructed some small obscuras to hang in the window of a city centre cafe which would show little live movies of the world outside, albeit it upside down.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sitting In Stagram</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;by &lt;a href=&quot;http://peteashton.com&quot;&gt;Pete Ashton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sitting In Stagram&lt;/strong&gt; re-appropriates Alvin Lucier’s seminal performative work &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Sitting_in_a_Room&quot;&gt;I Am Sitting In A Room&lt;/a&gt; (1969), exploring remix culture and the aesthetics of image copying on Instagram as it was in early 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I Am Sitting In A Room features Lucier recording himself, playing the recording back into the room and re-recording it until it becomes unintelligible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Instagram has no mechanic for reposting (unlike, say, Tumblr), users who want to “regram” an image take a screen capture and post it as a new image. Each reposting introduces generational loss as the image is transcoded from PNG to JPG and optimised by Instagram. While initially irrelevant, the loss adds up and the image degrades. (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theawl.com/2014/12/the-triumphant-rise-of-the-shitpic&quot;&gt;The Triumphant Rise Of The Shitpic&lt;/a&gt; for more context.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decay through user attrition is a rare example of digital sharing having an effect on the file itself. A platform that requires tran- and re-encoding of data introduces imperfections analogous to smudges, scratches and fingerprints on physical media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://peteashton.com/images/lucier.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work regrams the same image 90 times until it becomes noise. The 90 images are compiled into a video running at 6 frames per second, fitting the 15-second time limit of Instagram. Finally, the video is uploaded where it auto-plays in the Instagram stream, decaying in front of people’s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four videos were made in early 2015. The main video features Alvin Lucier himself. Additionally, his text has been adapted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I am logged into an Instagram account, identical to the one you are in now. I am posting a photograph and I am going to screen-shot and repost it again and again until the compression artefacts of the algorithm reinforce themselves so that any semblance of the photo, with perhaps the exception of pattern, is destroyed. What you will see, then, is the algorithm of Instagram articulated by photography. I regard this activity not so much as a demonstration of a physical fact, but more as a way to smooth out any irregularities my photo might have.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happened on the Instagram account &lt;a href=&quot;http://instagram.com/sitting_in_stagram&quot;&gt;@sitting_in_stagram&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/119002441&quot;&gt;a video&lt;/a&gt; of the work being made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things that are (probably) happening:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Instagram app renders JPEG on iPhone screen.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Screen capture creates PNG from pixel data on screen.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;App converts PNG into editable format.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;App saves edited (cropped) image in some format (JPEG?) and sends to Instagram server.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Server converts an optimises image into JPEG for transmission across network.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;App requests data and renders JPEG on iPhone screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-works&quot;&gt;The Works&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The four pieces live on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/zGWlDiH0o1/&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://instagram.com/p/wL6EddtJCE/&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/zBHD3Dn0ni/&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://instagram.com/p/q7UUTyFOU9/&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/yzk7kpH0oy/&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (image my own)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no original ideas and that is an awesome thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ooh-coverage&quot;&gt;Ooh! Coverage!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the first month at least 950,000 people heard about this project, which is insane. (I can track the times a web page loads my video, so this doesn’t include articles without the video embedded.) After the first few solid articles (in bold), most of them are content farms leaching copy off other content farms, and the whole experience was probably an artwork in and of itself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

为节省流量、容量，很多照片社交软件都会对照片进行有损压缩上传处理，再加上JPEG格式不可逆的累积劣化本性，严格来说每一次对照片进行的处理都是一个劣化过程。只是我们平时只做一次上传，所以这种劣化根本察觉不到。 不过质变总有一个量变的过程。&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Which Am I Most Like? Typologies</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/which-am-i.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015 I became interested in how people were sharing images on Instagram, a platform which did not allow reposting or reblogging which was the dominant form at the time thanks to platforms like Tumblr and Pinterest. You could fave something on Instagram but not move it into your own stream easily. Apps were available but they were fiddly. The simplest way was to take a screenshot of your phone and repost that, cropping out the surrounding interface as accurately as you cared to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process invokes all manner of image transformation and compression processes which mean that, in theory, each reposting of an image is in some way unique. This is not unlike the photocopying of a funny cartoon found on an office noticeboard in the 1980s, off-centre and greyed out having been through the copier countless times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian Feldman also noticed this trend, coined the term Shitpic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theawl.com/2014/12/the-triumphant-rise-of-the-shitpic/&quot;&gt;and wrote a wondeful article about their rise and meaning&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When you pair the format’s inherent need to be screencapped in order to attain virality with Instagram’s prevention of downloading images, you get an endless cycle of screencapping and compression through uploading. Throw in the occasional filter, or watermark, or regram tag, and let the process carry itself out for a while, and eventually you get a Shitpic. The layers pile up, burying and distorting the original.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The rise of the Shitpic demonstrates just how little ownership there is on the internet: Shoddy workarounds and subpar image quality are a small sacrifice to make, so long as your version of a joke goes viral instead of someone else’s. That the image is a muddled cacophony of compression artifacts and blurry emoji matters little, so long as your screenname is above it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this period I was downloading lots of selfies from Instagram which inevitably involved clearing out wrongly tagged images, and came across the &lt;em&gt;Which Am I Most Like?&lt;/em&gt; meme. I noticed that most of them were reposted in this way and had subtle differences, so I set my robot up to download as many as it could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://artworks.peteashton.com/which-am-i/&quot;&gt;I put the results in an HTML table&lt;/a&gt; which embeds the images as binary data so they are exactly as they arrived on my computer in rows for each type. “Typologies” refers to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://openlibrary.org/books/OL3699089M/Typologies&quot;&gt;work of the same name&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernd_and_Hilla_Becher&quot;&gt;Bernd and Hilla Becher&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My intention was to present them in some more aesthetically pleasing way that somehow measured their uniqueness, but I never did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An exercise in image degredation, riffing off Alvin Lucier’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Sitting_in_a_Room&quot;&gt;I Am Sitting In A Room&lt;/a&gt;. The Last Supper is turned into a globe and rotated 10,000 times in ImageMagick. Each rotation saves a new JPEG which compresses the image degrading it slightly. When does it stop being the Last Supper? Is the question I was asking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also produced a cropped version so you can see the degradation close up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/115934854&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

        <title>Slitscanned Presidential Addresses</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/slitscan_obama.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slit-scan_photography&quot;&gt;Slitscanning&lt;/a&gt; is a process by which a moving image is sampled one strip of pixels at a time, and those strips are stacked together to create a image where time can be read from side to side. It is one of those processes that is quite simple but rather hard to explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Slitscan movie repeats this process, shifting along one frame or one pixel, creating a new movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slitscanned Presidential Addresses uses three key speeches from Clinton, Bush and Obama made on the at attack on Iraq, the second Gulf War and the assassination of Bin Laden. These speeches are made in a very formal way, with the president speaking to a fixed camera against a still background. As such, the background isn’t affected by the scanning, while the movements of the presidents are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual speech itself does not sync with the new movie, as the temporal plane has changed, so I used a related technique to produce new soundtracks. The audio was exported as a spectrograph image using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://warmplace.ru/soft/ans/&quot;&gt;ANS synth&lt;/a&gt;, manipulated in Photoshop (Clinton’s was “split into 20 strips and shifted incrementally by 25 pixels to the right” (I’m not sure what this means), Bush was rotated 90°, and Obama’s skewed), and played back through the ANS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never been 100% happy with this work. I think it could be something special but it doesn’t quite work. I may remake it at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;clinton&quot;&gt;Clinton&lt;/h2&gt;

        <title>Cross City Walks</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/xcw2-002142.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the winter of 2014/15 &lt;a href=&quot;http://andyhowlett.co.uk&quot;&gt;Andy Howlett&lt;/a&gt; and myself undertook &lt;a href=&quot;http://xcw.org.uk/index.html%3Fp=16.html&quot;&gt;four walks&lt;/a&gt; across Birmingham in as straight a line as possible using the Outer Circle 11 bus route in Birmingham as our boundary. We called then Cross City Walks, aka XCW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We take a bus stop on the 11 route and draw a straight line to Birmingham Cathedral. Cathedrals are often, traditionally, the centre of a city and it felt right to choose this over, say, the Rotunda or Town Hall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The line is then continued to the opposite bus stop and the route is set. We walk the route keeping as close as possible to the line. This is the only rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hope is, by sticking to this line, we will connect parts of Birmingham that are not normally connected, and by bisecting the city we will be forced to compare the suburbs that sit opposite each other. And by enforcing this rule we will see things we wouldn’t normally see and experience the city in new ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pete wears a Go-Pro camera strapped to his chest which takes a photograph every five seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andy carries a fold-out A-Z map with the line drawn on it and tries to keep us on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cross City Walks were presented as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/xcw-flatpack/&quot;&gt;interactive movie exhibit at the 2015 Flatpack Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Birmingham Camera Obscura</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/bco_cocomad2015.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Birmingham Camera Obscura is the official title for the second device to come out of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bhamobscura.com&quot;&gt;Bham Obscura project&lt;/a&gt;, run by Jenny Duffin and myself. After our &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/bhamobscura-1/&quot;&gt;proof-of-concept&lt;/a&gt; proved the concept and got a fair amount of attention, we decided to crowdfund to pay a carpenter and lens-maker to help us make a proper camera that would last a bit longer than 2 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/peteashton/birmingham-camera-obscura&quot;&gt;We raised £2500 on Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; in November 2014 and had the camera ready for the public by summer 2015 launching at the Cocomad festival in Cotteridge. The body was built to our specs by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mjmbespoke.com&quot;&gt;Matt Moore&lt;/a&gt; and the lens hand-polished by an elderly gentleman near Hull who does not have a website. The lens housing was donated by another obscura enthusiast who had it made a decade previously. The project of making and running the camera was a residency at &lt;a href=&quot;http://bom.org.uk&quot;&gt;Birmingham Open Media&lt;/a&gt; for two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camera is designed to flat-pack down and fit in a hatchback car (specifically my Hyundia i20). It can be taken anywhere and set up within an hour. The lens and mirror are astronomy-grade and produce an incredible clear and sharp image, though the wide aperture (5 inches) and relatively short focal distance (cameras like this are usually on towers - ours is on the ground) means the depth-of-field is dramatically narrow. The end result under bright sunlight is a image that is beyond high-definition but does not seem quite real due to the narrow focus. It is quite uncanny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Bham Obscura project was active we took the camera to numerous public events and worked with four artists to produce &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/BCO-RandD/&quot;&gt;new works&lt;/a&gt; specific to the camera. Our intention was to build a business around this device but that proved too much and, as other work took over around 2016, we reverted it to being a hobby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camera lives in my shed and I try to take it out in public at least once a year, making small modifications and improvements along the way. Camera obscuras are a large part of my artistic practice thanks to the work done on this device and I am keen to revive the project at some point in the future. In the meanwhile if you’re interested in working with it, please get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Birmingham Open Media Fellowship</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/BOM_fellow.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I asked Karen Newman to mentor me through the process of becoming at artist she was herself in the process of setting up a new art space in Birmingham that would focus broadly on the space where art, technology and science intersect. To cut a long story short this became &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bom.org.uk&quot;&gt;Birmingham Open Media, aka BOM&lt;/a&gt;, based in the back streets right by New St Station. Opened in Novmber 2014 on a showstring budget BOM was in many ways an experiment in running such a space, iterating over time and relaunching in October 2018 as a fully-functioning, Arts Council funded arts organisation with a focussed programme of events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the start BOM has had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bom.org.uk/bom-fellows/&quot;&gt;Fellows programme&lt;/a&gt; of artists, scientists and technologists, initially to help guide the development of BOM, sort of like a creative board, developing into a variation of an artist development programme. Fellows have access to the studio space 24/7 and mentoring support from BOM. They are involved with educational and outreach programmes run by BOM and take part in an annual exhibition of their work. And much else besides!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was an inagural Fellow and continued in the programme until December 2016. During 2017 I remained at BOM developing my exhibition Instructions for Humans which ran in the Autumn 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a BOM Fellow was incredibly important to my development as an artist, giving me the space and, more importantly, permission to push myself into interesting areas. It is incredibly doubtful I would be where I am now without BOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of my activities during 2015-17 were developed and housed at BOM, but Fellowship-specific projects included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;BOM Fellows exhibition March 2015 featuring &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/sitting-in-stagram/&quot;&gt;Sitting Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;BOM Awards - mentoring a final year BCU student through their exhibition.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;BOM Fellows Live R&amp;amp;D exhibition March 2016 featuring Speculative Cameras.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/art-in-crisis/&quot;&gt;Art in Crisis&lt;/a&gt; workshop and exhibition.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Heartlands School workshops.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Speaking at Association for Photography in Higher Education Summer Conference 2017&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Art &amp;amp; Social workshop - &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/bom-art-tech-spec-cam/&quot;&gt;Speculative Cameras&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and much more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Live Sonification of Photography</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/If_Wet_2014-Oct-30.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live Sonification of Photography&lt;/strong&gt; was a performance / lecture at sound-art salon &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ifwet.org.uk/&quot;&gt;If Wet&lt;/a&gt; in of a new system for turning photographs into sound as a performance piece incorporating portrature, image manipulation and the ANS synth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/110096716?byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the culmination of a year or so’s work exploring slit-scan photography, performance photography, sonification of images and many other disparate things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation is about 25 minutes long with 10 minutes of intro, 10 minutes of demo and 5 minutes of Q&amp;amp;A. Thanks to Sam Underwood and David Morton for hosting.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ikon Traces</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photography art-walk commissioned by &lt;a href=&quot;https://ikon-gallery.org/&quot;&gt;Ikon&lt;/a&gt; as part of their 50th anniversary, run in partnership with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stillwalking.org/&quot;&gt;Still Walking&lt;/a&gt; festival.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://ikon-gallery.org/event/ikon-traces-walking-tour/&quot;&gt;the event page&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Starting in an octagonal kiosk in the Bull Ring in 1965 the Ikon Gallery has had five permanent venues in Birmingham city centre. As part of the Ikon Traces season, artist Pete Ashton asks “do these locations still have residual art-power?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Armed with key examples of visual art from Ikon’s history and channeling the ghosts of past venues, we will tune our eyes and look at the city through this filter. Then, with our aesthetic neurons firing, we’ll take photographs, creating new artworks from the vibrations of the old”. Pete Ashton&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is a lighthearted and fun walk open to everyone with a camera and a willingness to look at the city in new ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The walk started with a cleansing ritual. Participants were asked to join hands to form a hexagon on the approximate location of the original Ikon kiosk, now long demolished, while I recited the names of all the artists who had exhibited there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peteash10/Artworks/master/images/ikontraces_seance.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then passed out a booklet containing maps, illustrations and photographs from the four Ikon venues, along with colour photocopies of artworks taken from Ikon’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://ikon-gallery.org/shop/catalogues/ikon-some-of-the-best-things-in-life-happen-accidentally/&quot;&gt;60s&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ikon-gallery.org/shop/catalogues/ikon-this-could-happen-to-you/&quot;&gt;70s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ikon-gallery.org/shop/catalogues/as-exciting-as-we-can-make-it/&quot;&gt;80s&lt;/a&gt; retrospectives which I asked them to use as framing devices, tuning their minds before taking photographs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/peteash10/Artworks/blob/master/Ikon%20Traces/Ikon%20Traces%20booklet%20A5.pdf&quot;&gt;Here’s the booklet (20MB)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Prototype Birmingham Obscura</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bhamobscura.com&quot;&gt;Birmingham Camera Obscura&lt;/a&gt; is an ongoing project co-founded by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jennyduffin.com&quot;&gt;Jenny Duffin&lt;/a&gt; and myself in 2014. The story goes that we met when running a &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/BAF-pinhole/&quot;&gt;pinhole camera workshop&lt;/a&gt; where an off-hand comment about turning the classroom into a giant camera caused us to pause, look at each other and the rest is history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having converted a &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/rotunda-obscura/&quot;&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/theatre_obscura/&quot;&gt;rooms&lt;/a&gt;, we built our first lens-based camera obscura in the summer of 2014. We didn’t know what we were doing, but we knew it would be interesting. Somehow we learned that +1 closeup filters focussed a projected image at roughly 1 metre, meaning we needed a 1 metre box. Neither of us knew anything about carpentry (something I’ve rectified since, and would highly recommend to any artist) and the resulting construction reflected that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also knew we needed a mirror and spent a while shining torches at mirrors in charity shops until we found one that didn’t “ghost”. And finally we wanted it to be mobile, so a trip to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://birminghambikefoundry.org&quot;&gt;local bike shop&lt;/a&gt; was in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a while to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/bco/bco_1_01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/bco/bco_1_02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/bco/bco_1_03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/bco/bco_1_04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially we had people stand on a stool and look through a hole in the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/bco/bco_1_05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later we got rid of the box model and made a triangular black bag which hung in the frame with a hole on the front that you put you head through. We disguised its bin-bag looks with a funky piece of gold cloth from Birmingham’s Rag Market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/bco/bco_1_06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/bco/bco_1_07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that it worked at all is a testament to the simplicity of the camera obscura, and its flaws only spurred us on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took it to the following events over the late summer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Digbeth First Friday&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Warwick Bar Summer Fete&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coventry’s Festival of Imagineers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Midlands Arts Centre&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eye Candy Festival&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Moseley Folk Festival&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone loved it, despite (and sometimes because) of its DIY appearance. It was about this time we realised we were onto something. An art project that stimulates you intellectually and creatively while making people happy is a rare thing. We knew we had to continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the sunlight got less reliable we took what we’d learned and decided to fundraise for a new camera using Kickstarter. We raised £2500 and &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/bhamobscura-2/&quot;&gt;set to work&lt;/a&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bhamobscura.com&quot;&gt;Birmingham Obscura&lt;/a&gt;, or Birmingham Camera Obscura, was started by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jennyduffin.com/&quot;&gt;Jenny Duffin&lt;/a&gt; and myself in 2014 when we decided to build a camera obscura and take it around for people to experience. It has manifested in a number of projects, mainly based around the &lt;a href=&quot;https://art.peteashton.com/bhamobscura-2/&quot;&gt;professional-grade camera&lt;/a&gt; we crowdfunded to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project has formally been on hiatus since 2017 as work and other projects took up our time, but I continued to do occasional obscura work (I try and take the main camera out in public at least once a year) and am keen to bring it back if a sustainable plan can be hatched. If you are interested in joining the Birmingham Obscura project, please get in touch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://bhamobscura.com&quot;&gt;bhamobscura.com&lt;/a&gt; website archives our activities from 2014-17 and will at some point be revised. There are also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/bhamobscura/sets/&quot;&gt;many photos on Flickr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I Am Spinning In A Room</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/98183892&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Riffing off Alvin Lucier’s classic &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Sitting_in_a_Room&quot;&gt;I Am Sitting In A Room&lt;/a&gt;, I took a selfie, turned it into a disc and repeatedly asked &lt;a href=&quot;https://imagemagick.org/&quot;&gt;ImageMagick&lt;/a&gt; to rotate it by 1 degree 10,000 times. Each rotation meant re-saving the file as a JPEG, a lossy format which throws away a small amount of data. Usually this is unnoticeable but by repeating the process 10,000 times the image quickly degrades. The soundtrack is the strip of pixels at 6 o’clock for each frame fed through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://warmplace.ru/soft/ans/&quot;&gt;Virtual ANS&lt;/a&gt; synth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work builds on &lt;a href=&quot;https://art.peteashton.com/spectral-slitscanned-selfies/&quot;&gt;Spectral Selfies&lt;/a&gt; and the degradation was an accidental discovery while developing &lt;a href=&quot;https://art.peteashton.com/live-sonification-photography/&quot;&gt;Live Sonification of Photography&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Spectral Songs of the Slitscanned Selfies</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Spectral Songs of the Slitscanned Selfies builds on &lt;a href=&quot;https://art.peteashton.com/flatland-selfies/&quot;&gt;Flatland Selfies&lt;/a&gt; by adding the dimension of sound. I had been playing with Alexander Zolotov’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://warmplace.ru/soft/ans/&quot;&gt;Virtual ANS&lt;/a&gt;, based on a mid-20th century Russian instrument, which treats 2D images as spectrograms, reading them from left to right and turning them into sound. Unlike most instruments it breaks down into a potentially infinite number of microtones creating an eerie spacey sound that was used in a number of Soviet sci-fi movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the ANS allows you to see what photos sounded like. I later used this technique in the lecture/performance &lt;a href=&quot;https://art.peteashton.com/live-sonification-photography/&quot;&gt;Live Sonification of Photography&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Flatland Selfies</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland&quot;&gt;Flatland&lt;/a&gt; is an 1884 novel by Edwin A. Abbott which attempts to explain the concept of a fourth dimension by describing our three-dimensional experience from the point of a view of a two dimensional creature. A circle’s experience of a sphere is analogous to our experience of a 4D &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube&quot;&gt;hypercube&lt;/a&gt;, goes the thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always liked the Flatland model since first coming across it in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rudyrucker.com/thefourthdimension/&quot;&gt;Rudy Rucker’s &lt;em&gt;The Fourth Dimension&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and while playing around with slicing and dicing pictures using &lt;a href=&quot;https://imagemagick.org/&quot;&gt;ImageMagick&lt;/a&gt; I wondered how a resident of Flatland might experience a photograph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The images I used came from a massive stash of selfies I’d downloaded from Instagram (when Instagram had a very lax API which allowed such things).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following videos are three different attempts to show this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/97121833&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/97180955&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/97184995&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;312&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This led directly to &lt;a href=&quot;https://art.peteashton.com/spectral-slitscanned-selfies/&quot;&gt;Spectral Songs of the Slitscanned Selfies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Typologies of Hypernetworked Vernacular Self-Portraiture</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During 2013 I become a bit obsessed with selfies, specifically how they were dismissed by “proper” photographers and adopted predominantly by young women. Those two things seemed connected. I collected hundreds of thousands from Instagram (their API was very liberal at the time and allowed bulk downloading) and set about making sense of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting video essay was included in a shorts screening at the Flatpack Film Festival 2014. The title has meaning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Typologies - from the classic work by Bernd and Hilla Becher.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hypernetworked - that which is on the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vernacular - of the people. Vernacular photography is the only true photography.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Self-Portrature - selfies, by any other name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/90148397&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

        <title>Theatre Obscura</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A week after &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/rotunda-obscura/&quot;&gt;turning the Rotunda into a camera&lt;/a&gt;, Jenny’s contacts book got us the use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oldjointstocktheatre.co.uk&quot;&gt;The Old Joint Stock’s third-floor theatre&lt;/a&gt; overlooking Birmingham Cathedral, so we decided to turn that into a camera too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a theatre, the room was already blacked out so most of the work was spent on the “screen”. The resulting image was very pleasing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rotunda Obscura</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During our &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/BAF-pinhole/&quot;&gt;Pinhole Camera Workshop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jennyduffin.com&quot;&gt;Jenny Duffin&lt;/a&gt; and I casually mentioned that we could turn the room we were working in into a camera if we wanted to. A few months later we did. But not any room. Thanks to her contacts as an arts producer, Jenny secured a penthouse flat on the top floor of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotunda_(Birmingham)&quot;&gt;Birmingham’s Rotunda&lt;/a&gt; and we set about blacking it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we weren’t using a lens, the aperture of our camera was a small hole cut in the plastic. The resulting projection was very dim and could barely be seen even when eyes had adjusted so photos were taken with long, up to 10-minute, exposures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we experimented with a smaller bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/rotundaobs01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/rotundaobs02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/rotundaobs03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we moved to the main room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/rotundaobs04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/rotundaobs05.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/rotundaobs06.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/rotundaobs07.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We learned a lot from this experiment which lead directly to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bhamobscura.com&quot;&gt;Birmingham Camera Obscura&lt;/a&gt; project. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stayingcool.com&quot;&gt;Staying Cool&lt;/a&gt;, custodians of the Rotunda’s upper floors, for their generous loan of a luxury apartment for us to (very carefully) cover in black plastic.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Photographic Exploration of Place</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/g4a2013_application.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photographic Exploration of Place was a period of artistic development in 2013 funded by an Arts Council Grant for the Arts resulting in a series of group walks where participants were invited to take photographs while engaging with sound art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to build on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://photo-school.co.uk/walks/&quot;&gt;photo walks&lt;/a&gt; I’d been running through Photo School by exploring psychogeographic methods and collaboration with other artists. A Psychogeography Workshop was held in September with &lt;a href=&quot;https://cathywade.co.uk&quot;&gt;Cathy Wade&lt;/a&gt; to explore the history and traditions and how they might be applied to a walking practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was inspired to work with sound artists having &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/albums/72157633358548063&quot;&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mirrors.peteashton.com/ifwet.org.uk/&quot;&gt;If Wet&lt;/a&gt; salon for experimental musicians where I used the processes and ideas expressed there to challenge my thinking about photography - when they said sound, I thought about light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The artists I chose to work with were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mrunderwood.co.uk&quot;&gt;Sam Underwood&lt;/a&gt;, the co-founder of If Wet, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundkitchenuk.org&quot;&gt;SoundKitchen&lt;/a&gt;, a collective of artists who had run a “sound walk” as part of the Still Walking festival the year before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/soundwalk-sam.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The walks took place at weekends in November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;walk-1---guided-listening-with-iain-armstrong-of-soundkitchen&quot;&gt;Walk 1 - Guided Listening with Iain Armstrong of Soundkitchen.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iain Armstrong lead the listening exercises, effectively tuning people’s perception of the environment through their ears. He used different techniques for each section of the walk which I translated into photographic techniques. So when he asked people to listen to distant sounds I got them to look for distant subjects. When he got them to hear movement I asked them to photograph movement. The instructions were simple, giving people freedom to interpret them loosely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;walk-2---micro-listening-with-sam-underwood&quot;&gt;Walk 2 - Micro-listening with Sam Underwood&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sam’s walk was theoretically similar to Ian’s but had a distinctly different remit. While Iain had very much been exploring the landscape I wanted Sam to help people explore the details. Sam brought a van-load of tools - contact microphones, stethoscopes, hydrophones, amplifiers and headphones - so people could hear the small sounds that echo through the fabric of Digbeth. I wanted to relate this to close-up and abstract photography where the photographer gets in close and reveals aspects of a place not obvious to the casual eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;walk-3---soundtracked-walk-by-annie-mahtani-of-soundkitchen&quot;&gt;Walk 3 - Soundtracked walk by Annie Mahtani of Soundkitchen.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annie Mahtani prepared a 60 minute soundtrack built up from field recordings made in Birmingham which I asked participants to listen to at the same time as we walked together along a predefined route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/collectivephotography.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcome of the funded period was an ebook titled “Collective Photography”, made available to &lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/collectivephotography/&quot;&gt;download in various formats at LeanPub&lt;/a&gt;. I blurbed it as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What does it mean to photograph as a group? How can leading such groups be an artistic practice? Based on a year researching photography and guided walking in Birmingham, the book follows Pete Ashton as he navigates his first Arts Council grant and becomes an Artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 21st February 2014 I also presented the work at &lt;a href=&quot;http://manyandvaried.org.uk/projects/bees2014/&quot;&gt;Bees in a Tin&lt;/a&gt;, a gathering of artists “who make or are interested in unique interfaces for the world around them”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/91i5v7r3fteafh3/collectivephotography.pdf?dl=0&quot;&gt;PDF of the book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Pinhole Camera Workshop for Bham Architecture Festival</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a pinhole photography workshop run with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jennyduffin.com&quot;&gt;Jenny Duffin&lt;/a&gt; for the Birmingham Architecture Festival. It was notable because we then went on to co-run the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bhamobscura.com&quot;&gt;Birmingham Camera Obscura&lt;/a&gt; project together which changed everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, while we’ve done many many things we’ve never run a pinhole workshop again.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ikon Gallery workshops</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During 2013-15 I did a number of workshops for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ikon-gallery.org&quot;&gt;Ikon gallery&lt;/a&gt;’s education department, using photography to drive engagement with the lead art exhibition at that time. These were devised with then-head of education Simon Taylor and mostly fell under their Masterclass strand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The format was fairly simple. After an introduction from myself to around 10 participants, a curator or member of Ikon’s team would lead the group around the gallery, talking about the work with a particular emphasis on the artist’s process. How did they approach making their work and how did their methodology help them achieve their aims? That sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to the classroom we would then discuss how we could apply this way of thinking to our photography. In some cases, such as AK Dolven, we twisted our ideas of “good” photography, defocussing and breaking the rules to achieve new abstractions. In others, such as Hurvin Anderson’s paintings, we absorbed his subject matter to focus our point of view of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time moved on, staffing changed, and the Masterclasses dried up, but I have fond memories of them and would love to work again with arts organisations to use photography to get their audiences to creatively engage with their exhibits. Hit me up if you’re interested and have a budget.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dirty New Media</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2013 I was asked by my friend and Vivid Projects curator Antonio Roberts to photography an event he was running for the documentation. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vividprojects.org.uk/programme/revolution-02-dirty-new-media/&quot;&gt;Dirty New Media&lt;/a&gt; was a follow-up to &lt;a href=&quot;http://gli.tc/h/&quot;&gt;GLI.TC/H&lt;/a&gt; which he had brought to Birmingham in 2011. As I took my photos the following things went through my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I could do that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I would never do that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;That’s brilliant.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I did something like that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;That’s stupid, and I can explain why.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I want to do something like that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically I felt I was watching a peer group I should, or could, be part of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, on 21st March 2013 I decided to actually become a proper artist, doing this sort of thing as professionally as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I happened to be sitting next to Karen Newman, now director of &lt;a href=&quot;http://bom.org.uk&quot;&gt;Birmingham Open Media&lt;/a&gt;, and asked her if she did mentoring for people who thought they might be artists. The rest is documented on this website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/albums/72157633073961488&quot;&gt;Photos I took&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Photo School with Pete Ashton</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/photo-school-logo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photo-school.co.uk&quot;&gt;Photo School&lt;/a&gt; was started in 2012 by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mattmurtagh&quot;&gt;Matt Murtagh&lt;/a&gt; and myself when we noticed that many of our non-photographer friends were buying fully-functional DSLR cameras as the prices had recently dropped to the same as a decent compact. They didn’t know how to use them, but they weren’t interested in doing a long course run by a college to become a “professional” - they just wanted to take better pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We trailed a number of classes using Matt’s academic photographic knowledge and my experience in social media training, settling on a Beginners model which, with yearly iterations, still runs to this day. After a couple of years Matt ceased freelancing and, with his blessing, I took on Photo School as my own project, developing it to comprise a quarter of my freelance income and folding it into my art practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photo School is centred around &lt;a href=&quot;http://photo-school.co.uk/beginners-photography/&quot;&gt;Beginners Photography&lt;/a&gt;, enabling me to refine my knowledge of camera technology by repeatedly explaining it in new ways to different people. I also run regular &lt;a href=&quot;http://photo-school.co.uk/walks/&quot;&gt;Photo Walks&lt;/a&gt; around Birmingham which I see as equal parts photography class, community activity, guided tour and, of course, art. The walks lead to my first Arts Council funded activity, Photographic Exploration of Space, where I explored ideas around group photography as a collaborative artwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photo School continues to be an important part of my work and art practice and runs from the website &lt;a href=&quot;photo-school.co.uk&quot;&gt;photo-school.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>IMG_4228</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;IMG_4228 started when, in 2012, I uploaded a video to YouTube without changing the filename, and all the recommended videos also had that filename, this being the only thing they had in common (YouTube hadn’t weaponised their recommendation engine at this point). The variety intrigued me so I downloaded them all and played them back, recording the desktop as a kind of performance space (inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;http://jonsatrom.com&quot;&gt;Jon Satrom&lt;/a&gt;’s prepared desktops).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/34801741&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I next went to Flickr which had a deeper range of un-renamed files and downloaded thousands of IMG_4228.jpg images. I now had a “data set” worthy of some crunching, so I looked at how best to view them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In sequence at 15 frames per second:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/35092853&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As contact sheets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/35092220&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As arrays of colour fields using the average colour:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/35112704&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This final effect struck me as pleasing and I used it again for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/instabeck&quot;&gt;Instabeck&lt;/a&gt; commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before this I tested it out as a mock-proposal (the deadline had passed) for a project called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.werk.org.uk/projects/48-sheet&quot;&gt;48 Sheet&lt;/a&gt; where artists would take over advertising billboards. I downloaded as many photos from Flickr tagged “sellyoak”, reduced them to pixels and composited them onto the StreetView image of a local hoarding, putting abstractions of Selly Oak back into Selly Oak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/Billboard_Selly_Oak.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dead Space</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Dead Space was a series of exhibitions organised by Clare Farrell (now working as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.werk.org.uk&quot;&gt;WERK&lt;/a&gt;) building on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lucy.beat13.co.uk/outside/udhutxk86mifo5fy4eeglk0lrb0uw1&quot;&gt;mural paintings by Lucy McLauchlan&lt;/a&gt; on the now-demolished Birmingham Central Library.  Clare invited me to make some work using the TTV Photography technique and despite a very limited budget (£100) I decided to build a giant sculpture using old CRT monitors and cardboard tubes to showcase video work I’d been making recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;outside&quot;&gt;Outside&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I obviously didn’t know what I was doing and afterwards wasn’t sure what had happened or whether it was any good, but in hindsight I’m pleased with it as a first stab at being a “proper” exhibiting artist, rather than someone who sells prints at markets.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ikon Slow Boat</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/ikonslowboat_logo.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slow Boat was a three year programme run by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ikon-gallery.org/event/ikon-youth-programme-2/&quot;&gt;Ikon gallery’s Youth Programme&lt;/a&gt; (IYP) where a group of young people aged 15-19 from Birmingham meet regularly to make artwork, meet other young people, host events and develop their own projects. The Slow Boat was a converted canal boat and a catalyst for exhibitions, events and discussion. Each year IYP members started by working closely with a lead contemporary artist who shared their practice with the group. IYP worked on board to organise a programme of activity and explore the canal network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After doing the Ikon’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/ikon-favourite-things/&quot;&gt;Favourite Things&lt;/a&gt; talk, I was hired by &lt;a href=&quot;http://kateself.com&quot;&gt;Kate Self&lt;/a&gt; to develop the Slow Boat website. I proposed that rather than take the fee for a fancy design, we use a simple Wordpress blog and build it up over the year, treating it as a notebook and repository for photos, video and texts. (At the time, before social media as we now know it had established itself, blogging was the big thing and I had carved a niche in Birmingham helping arts organisations to do it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work here was essentially support for Kate, developing her knowledge as much as providing the website, and could be considered another web-dev job amongst many I took at this time. But due to working closely with Kate I build a relationship with Ikon’s educational department which doubtless influenced my development as an artist over the next few years, specifically the photography masterclasses I ran.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Birmingham Zine Festival 2010 Talk</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2010 there was a Zine Festival in Birmingham. Zines and self published magazines were a very important part of my early adulthood and inform pretty much everything I’ve done since, so I was intrigued to see how this pre-internet form of non-mainstream communication would be celebrated in an era when they weren’t so vital and necessary. Is it simply nostalgia for a more ‘real’ media, like vinyl aficionados, or is there something else going on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also felt it would be nice to bring some history to the table and chose to talk about the era that came before my 90s activity and which influenced me in a manner my work might influence the next generation. So I talked about &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/14873087&quot;&gt;The Emergence of the British Small Press Comics Scene in the Early 1980s&lt;/a&gt; to a rather bemused but polite audience of folks who probably saw zines as being for activist politics, not weird comics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/14873087&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;363&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decade later I would show my comics and zines at the Open Zine Archive.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Few Of My Favourite Things - Ikon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Ikon gallery in Birmingham had a series of talks called “These Are a Few of my Favourite Things”, a Desert Island Discs-style event where guests talk about eight works of art. For some reason I was asked to speak in the 2010 programme, presumably because the Created in Birmingham blog had mad a bit of an impact on these scene, or maybe they just had a space they needed to fill. Whatever the reasoning I blundered in with my selection of stuff-I-like-that-might-be-art and spoke to a surprisingly full room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ikon-gallery.org/event/these-are-a-few-of-my-favourite-things-22/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/ikon-fave-things.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite things were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Internet&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kottke.org&quot;&gt;kottke.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nan_Goldin&quot;&gt;Nan Goldin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The bubbleglass of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://flic.kr/p/fuWN5M&quot;&gt;Duaflex&lt;/a&gt; viewfinder.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Campbell&quot;&gt;Eddie Campbell&lt;/a&gt;’s ALEC&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artnet.com/artists/raymond-pettibon/&quot;&gt;Raymond Pettibon&lt;/a&gt;’s 80s zines and posters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Kleptones’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://kleptones.com/pages/downloads_hiphopera.html&quot;&gt;Night At The Hip-Hopera&lt;/a&gt; album.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://geekandsundry.com/our-favorite-song-classics-covered-by-mario-paint-composer/&quot;&gt;Mario Paint Composer covers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was interviewed by Kate Self, then an education officer at Ikon, who later hired me to do the website for their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ikon-gallery.org/event/ikon-youth-programme-2/&quot;&gt;youth programme&lt;/a&gt;, which led to a few photography masterclasses over the years. I’m still waiting for my solo show in the main gallery though…&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The 8-Bit Pete Lectures</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a short period as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiptune&quot;&gt;chiptune DJ&lt;/a&gt; at Kings Heath’s fashionable Hare and Hounds pub and was asked to show / present something at 7inch Cinema’s 8bit night on June 28th 2010. I ran this video and talked over it, attempting to explain what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/12914811&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; fullscreen&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7inch Cinema was the precursor to, and eventually folded into, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://flatpackfestival.org.uk&quot;&gt;Flatpack Film Festival&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I found the chiptune scene interesting because they made complex work with a very limited palette. Ironically I have zero interest in computer games. For this reason I stopped DJing at computer games events and 8bit Pete was retired.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>TTV Pete Exhibition</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/moseley-exchange-exhib.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In early 2010 I was asked by the Moseley Exchange co-working space if I’d like to hang some of my TTV Pete work on their walls. Around this time the digital camera I’d been using for TTV work had died and I was rejigging my process with a new camera, so I decided to do a retrospective on the first four years of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than select the best shots I printed everything from August 2006 to December 2009. It comprised 252 TTV photos mounted on 5 metres of board, each photo stuck down with gaffer/duct tape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, upon receiving an invoice, I discovered this was not a commission but a commercial opportunity and that I had to pay a hanging fee which would be recouped by selling the work. Surprisingly no-one was interested in buying a 5 metre wide duct-taped photo-montage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/albums/72157623549793932&quot;&gt;Photos of the work and of the launch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Created in Birmingham Shop</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/cibshop.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Created in Birmingham was a blog set up by myself in 2008 and run by a variety of people including Chris Unitt who, during his tenure, was invited by the Bull Ring shopping centre to run a pop-up shop for three months in the spring of 2010 in an empty unit in a prime location opposite the Apple Store. As I had retail experience I agreed to manange the day-to-day running of the shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many things can be said about the CiB shop. It was successful in many ways, bringing together a wider community of artists and makers and establishing friendships and collaborations which still run to this day. But hubris from that aparent success masked its failure as a functional retail enterprise, leading to questionable follow-up projects which Chris wisely stayed clear of but which I didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m proud of what we did in the Bull Ring. I wish I’d had the forsight to see it for what it was and not try to build upon it later.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Outer Circle Bus Stops</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/outercircle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A project run alongside Jon Bounds’ celebration of the Number 11 Bus in Birmingham which travels around the Outer Circle, taking in the full variety of suburbs that make up the city. I decided to photograph every other bus stop with my TTV camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really need to re-do this properly at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dunkirk</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/2008572&quot;&gt;Dunkirk&lt;/a&gt; was a short film made in 48 hours by Rachael Marchant, Danny Smith and myself in 2008 for a competition called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.createdinbirmingham.com/2008/09/08/film-dash-birminghams-48-hour-film-challenge/&quot;&gt;Film Dash&lt;/a&gt;. We were given the title “Dunkirk” and a quote which had to be included somewhere in the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main character is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bleeplabs.com/original_thingamagoop/&quot;&gt;Thingamagoop&lt;/a&gt;, an optical synthesiser I’d recently acquired, and his point of view was filmed through a Through the Viewfinder contraption. The “voice” is played on the Thingamagoop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We won the competition and our film was screened at the Electric Cinema.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>TTV Pete</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/ttvpete.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TTV Pete was my first attempt at an “artistic practice”, starting in August 2006 when I came across the technique on Flickr of photographying Through The Viewfinder of another, often vintage, camera. A community emerged around this technique, formalising jargon and encouraging innovation. By the time I abandoned it I had produced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/albums/72157594253244021&quot;&gt;over 2,000 images&lt;/a&gt; and spent two years selling prints at art markets and in shops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This period of experimental photography seeded many ideas which influenced my later art practice, specifically the speculative cameras / experimental capture research and work using camera obscuras.&lt;/p&gt;
