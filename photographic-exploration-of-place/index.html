<p>Photographic Exploration of Place was a period of artistic development in 2013 funded by an Arts Council Grant for the Arts resulting in a series of group walks where participants were invited to take photographs while engaging with sound art.</p>

<p>I decided to build on the <a href="http://photo-school.co.uk/walks/">photo walks</a> I’d been running through Photo School by exploring psychogeographic methods and collaboration with other artists. A Psychogeography Workshop was held in September with <a href="https://cathywade.co.uk">Cathy Wade</a> to explore the history and traditions and how they might be applied to a walking practice.</p>

<p>I was inspired to work with sound artists having <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/peteashton/albums/72157633358548063">documented</a> the <a href="http://mirrors.peteashton.com/ifwet.org.uk/">If Wet</a> salon for experimental musicians where I used the processes and ideas expressed there to challenge my thinking about photography - when they said sound, I thought about light.</p>

<p>The artists I chose to work with were <a href="http://www.mrunderwood.co.uk">Sam Underwood</a>, the co-founder of If Wet, and <a href="https://soundkitchenuk.org">SoundKitchen</a>, a collective of artists who had run a “sound walk” as part of the Still Walking festival the year before.</p>

<p><img src="http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/soundwalk-sam.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The walks took place at weekends in November.</p>

<h3 id="walk-1---guided-listening-with-iain-armstrong-of-soundkitchen">Walk 1 - Guided Listening with Iain Armstrong of Soundkitchen.</h3>

<p>Iain Armstrong lead the listening exercises, effectively tuning people’s perception of the environment through their ears. He used different techniques for each section of the walk which I translated into photographic techniques. So when he asked people to listen to distant sounds I got them to look for distant subjects. When he got them to hear movement I asked them to photograph movement. The instructions were simple, giving people freedom to interpret them loosely.</p>

<h3 id="walk-2---micro-listening-with-sam-underwood">Walk 2 - Micro-listening with Sam Underwood</h3>

<p>Sam’s walk was theoretically similar to Ian’s but had a distinctly different remit. While Iain had very much been exploring the landscape I wanted Sam to help people explore the details. Sam brought a van-load of tools - contact microphones, stethoscopes, hydrophones, amplifiers and headphones - so people could hear the small sounds that echo through the fabric of Digbeth. I wanted to relate this to close-up and abstract photography where the photographer gets in close and reveals aspects of a place not obvious to the casual eye.</p>

<h3 id="walk-3---soundtracked-walk-by-annie-mahtani-of-soundkitchen">Walk 3 - Soundtracked walk by Annie Mahtani of Soundkitchen.</h3>

<p>Annie Mahtani prepared a 60 minute soundtrack built up from field recordings made in Birmingham which I asked participants to listen to at the same time as we walked together along a predefined route.</p>

<p><img src="http://art.peteashton.com/assets/images/collectivephotography.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The outcome of the funded period was an ebook titled “Collective Photography”, made available to <a href="https://leanpub.com/collectivephotography/">download in various formats at LeanPub</a>. I blurbed it as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What does it mean to photograph as a group? How can leading such groups be an artistic practice? Based on a year researching photography and guided walking in Birmingham, the book follows Pete Ashton as he navigates his first Arts Council grant and becomes an Artist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On 21st February 2014 I also presented the work at <a href="http://manyandvaried.org.uk/projects/bees2014/">Bees in a Tin</a>, a gathering of artists “who make or are interested in unique interfaces for the world around them”.</p>
