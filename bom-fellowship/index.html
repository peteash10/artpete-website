<p>When I asked Karen Newman to mentor me through the process of becoming at artist she was herself in the process of setting up a new art space in Birmingham that would focus broadly on the space where art, technology and science intersect. To cut a long story short this became <a href="https://www.bom.org.uk">Birmingham Open Media, aka BOM</a>, based in the back streets right by New St Station. Opened in Novmber 2014 on a showstring budget BOM was in many ways an experiment in running such a space, iterating over time and relaunching in October 2018 as a fully-functioning, Arts Council funded arts organisation with a focussed programme of events.</p>

<p>From the start BOM has had a <a href="https://www.bom.org.uk/bom-fellows/">Fellows programme</a> of artists, scientists and technologists, initially to help guide the development of BOM, sort of like a creative board, developing into a variation of an artist development programme. Fellows have access to the studio space 24/7 and mentoring support from BOM. They are involved with educational and outreach programmes run by BOM and take part in an annual exhibition of their work. And much else besides!</p>

<p>I was an inagural Fellow and continued in the programme until December 2016. During 2017 I remained at BOM developing my exhibition Instructions for Humans which ran in the Autumn 2017.</p>

<p>Being a BOM Fellow was incredibly important to my development as an artist, giving me the space and, more importantly, permission to push myself into interesting areas. It is incredibly doubtful I would be where I am now without BOM.</p>

<p>Many of my activities during 2015-17 were developed and housed at BOM, but Fellowship-specific projects included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>BOM Fellows exhibition March 2015 featuring <a href="http://art.peteashton.com/sitting-in-stagram/">Sitting Instagram</a>.</li>
  <li>BOM Awards - mentoring a final year BCU student through their exhibition.</li>
  <li>BOM Fellows Live R&amp;D exhibition March 2016 featuring Speculative Cameras.</li>
  <li><a href="http://art.peteashton.com/art-in-crisis/">Art in Crisis</a> workshop and exhibition.</li>
  <li>Heartlands School workshops.</li>
  <li>Speaking at Association for Photography in Higher Education Summer Conference 2017</li>
  <li>Art &amp; Social workshop - <a href="http://art.peteashton.com/bom-art-tech-spec-cam/">Speculative Cameras</a>.</li>
  <li>and much more.</li>
</ul>
