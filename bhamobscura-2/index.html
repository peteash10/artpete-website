<p>The Birmingham Camera Obscura is the official title for the second device to come out of the <a href="http://bhamobscura.com">Bham Obscura project</a>, run by Jenny Duffin and myself. After our <a href="http://art.peteashton.com/bhamobscura-1/">proof-of-concept</a> proved the concept and got a fair amount of attention, we decided to crowdfund to pay a carpenter and lens-maker to help us make a proper camera that would last a bit longer than 2 months.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/peteashton/birmingham-camera-obscura">We raised £2500 on Kickstarter</a> in November 2014 and had the camera ready for the public by summer 2015 launching at the Cocomad festival in Cotteridge. The body was built to our specs by <a href="http://www.mjmbespoke.com">Matt Moore</a> and the lens hand-polished by an elderly gentleman near Hull who does not have a website. The lens housing was donated by another obscura enthusiast who had it made a decade previously. The project of making and running the camera was a residency at <a href="http://bom.org.uk">Birmingham Open Media</a> for two years.</p>

<p>The camera is designed to flat-pack down and fit in a hatchback car (specifically my Hyundia i20). It can be taken anywhere and set up within an hour. The lens and mirror are astronomy-grade and produce an incredible clear and sharp image, though the wide aperture (5 inches) and relatively short focal distance (cameras like this are usually on towers - ours is on the ground) means the depth-of-field is dramatically narrow. The end result under bright sunlight is a image that is beyond high-definition but does not seem quite real due to the narrow focus. It is quite uncanny.</p>

<p>While the Bham Obscura project was active we took the camera to numerous public events and worked with four artists to produce <a href="http://art.peteashton.com/BCO-RandD/">new works</a> specific to the camera. Our intention was to build a business around this device but that proved too much and, as other work took over around 2016, we reverted it to being a hobby.</p>

<p>The camera lives in my shed and I try to take it out in public at least once a year, making small modifications and improvements along the way. Camera obscuras are a large part of my artistic practice thanks to the work done on this device and I am keen to revive the project at some point in the future. In the meanwhile if you’re interested in working with it, please get in touch.</p>
